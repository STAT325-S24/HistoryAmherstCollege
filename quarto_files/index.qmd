# Background
This website provides the text and analysis of William Seymour Tyler's 1873 book _History of Amherst College during its first half century, 1821-1871_.

As part of this project from Amherst College's STAT325 (Text Analytics) class, we processed the scanned-in text version of book to create a more clean and organized form that is available as an [R package](data_package.qmd).
See [here](https://github.com/STAT325-S24/HistoryAmherstCollege) for the raw text and routines to process it.

The [Book Info Tab](book_info.qmd) gives more information about the publication of the book.
