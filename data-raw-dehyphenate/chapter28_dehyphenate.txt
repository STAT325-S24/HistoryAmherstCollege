CHAPTER XXVIII.

THEN AND NOW PANORAMIC REVIEW OF CHANGE AND PROGRESS.

WE have now gone over the successive periods of the history
of Amherst College during its first half century, and endeavored
to assign to persons, things and events their proper place in
that history. A brief general review, however, may give our
readers a better understanding of the growth and progress of
the Institution and the changes through which it has passed,
and will at the same time afford an opportunity of bringing in
some things for which we have found no other proper place.
We begin with the

COLLEGE GROUNDS.

At the time when the first efforts were made for founding a
College in Amherst, Col. Elijah Dickinson, a prominent citizen
distinguished for his energy and public spirit, owned the farm,
since known as Judge Dickinson's, which included the hill back
of the old meeting-house, now College Hill, stretched east as far
as the East Street and south nearly as far as it did east, and contained
in all two or three hundred acres. Col. Dickinson subscribed
the liberal sum of six hundred dollars to the Charity
Fund, and was deeply interested in the founding of the College,
but died, February 1, 1820, some six months before the laying
of the corner-stone for the first edifice. On the twentyrsecond
of November, 1820, some three months after the laying of the
corner-stone, and when the exterior of the building was already
finished, Mrs. Jerusha Dickinson, widow of Col. Elijah Dickinson,
and Moses Dickinson, his son, gave a deed of the land on
which all the earliest buildings were erected and which formed
the center and nucleus of the present College grounds. The
land, conveyed by this deed, comprised "nine acres more or
less," and was sold for one thousand one hundred and eightyseven
dollars and fifty cents, a part of which is understood to
have gone to pay Col. Dickinson's subscription.
[In his report announcing the completion of the fifty thousand dollar subscription,
Col. Graves speaks of "the -six acres of land given by Col. Elijah Dickinson." See
p. 50. This donation was afterwards modified, I suppose, as stated in the text
above. In the vote of the Trustees appointing a Committee to secure the title to
the land, it is spoken of as ten acres." See page 62.]
On the 7th
of December, 1827, the widow and heirs of Col. Dickinson further
deeded to the Trustees of the College some two and a half
acres more at the east end of the former lot, and a triangular
piece of nearly an acre at the south-west corner of the lot to
make the front, which before was narrower, equal in width to
the rear, for the consideration of four hundred and fifty dollars,
thus making the nucleus some twelve acres more or less at a
cost of one thousand six hundred and thirty-seven dollars and
fifty cents. It should be added that we find the names of the
heirs of Col. Dickinson (Moses Dickinson, Jonathan S. Dickinson
and Artemas Thompson who married a daughter of Col.
Dickinson,) as joint subscribers to a bond for one thousand dollars
of the fifteen thousand dollars which was subscribed to
make the fifty thousand dollar Charity Subscription pass unquestioned
and unquestionable through the ordeal of the Legislative
Committee in 1824.

In June, 1828, the Trustees purchased of Dea. John Leland
eleven acres more or less on the west side of the highway belonging
originally to the estate of Rev. Dr. Parsons, and including
the old "Parsons' House" with other buildings. This is
the land on which the President's House, the Library and College
Hall now stand. The sum paid for it was two thousand
dollars. It has been squared out by some small pieces not in
the original purchase, and reduced by the sale of the lots west
of the "back street," till now it comprises a little over five
acres.

In January, 1841, on petition of the Trustees, the town conveyed
to them without any pecuniary consideration "a quitclaim
deed " of all that part of the common on Meeting-House
Hill which lies in front of the original College lot except what
is needed for a highway, thus connecting the original lot with
the purchase on the west side, and enabling them for the first
time to enclose and extend the grounds as far west as the highway
and to build upon them. This, of course, includes the site
of the Octagonal Cabinet and the Observatory.

In June, 1861, the College purchased of Judge John Dickinson
for one thousand dollars five acres more of the old Col.
Dickinson farm, directly back of the original purchase, in order
to make a better site for the College Church and extend the
campus towards the east.

In December, 1866, in order to furnish a suitable site for
Walker Hall, open an avenue along the north side of the campus,
and clear the way for other improvements, the Trustees
bought of Lucius Boltwood, Esq., two and a half acres of land,
one-half acre of which is absorbed in the above mentioned avenue.
The sum paid for this purchase was nine thousand nine
hundred and fifty-six dollars and seventeen cents.

This enumeration of College grounds would be incomplete
without the mention of seven acres more or less given in trust
to the Trustees for the use of the College and the community
by Leavitt Hallock, Esq., and known as the Hallock Park.

The College grounds, exclusive of Hallock Park, now contain
not far from twenty-seven acres, and cost, for their purchase
money, not far from fifteen thousand dollars. The reader can
not have failed to observe the immense difference in the price per
acre of the first and the last purchase. The first was estimated at
about one hundred and thirty dollars an acre; the last cost
about four thousand dollars an acre, a price which all the Trustees
thought to be exorbitant, and which some protested to the last,
ought not to be paid, but which was paid because it seemed indispensable
to the perfection of Walker Hall. This history contains
a lesson for the founders of Colleges and Seminaries ; and
that is, that they should provide ample grounds at the outset to
meet the future wants of the Institution. Two things, however,
detract not a little from the practical value of this lesson. In
the first place, it is impossible to foresee all the future wants of
a College that really lives and flourishes. In the second place,
many a College is too poor at the beginning to provide even for
the wants which it does foresee. Amherst College is better able
to pay four thousand dollars an acre for land now than it was to
pay one hundred and thirty dollars at the beginning. Amherst
was then very much in the same situation as the man who said,
he could once have bought the site of Chicago for a pair of
boots. When asked, why he did not buy it : "I hadn't the pair
of boots," was the conclusive answer.

Nearly half of the College lot was covered with a grove or
forest at the time of the original purchase. Another portiorh-was
set apart, a little while, for cultivation, as a means of self-support
by the students. " They have purchased a large field on
the west side of which they have now built the College " so
says a communication in the Boston Recorder of September 1,
1821, which, although anonymous, seems to speak by authority,
" for the express purpose of affording each charity student an
opportunity of cultivating a quarter or half of an acre in that
manner which his taste and judgment shall dictate. . . . This is
an advantage which Amherst College will have over all the
other Colleges."

The College campus is so uneven in its surface that, with the
exception perhaps of East College, there has never been a building
erected on it without considerable expense in grading and
terracing. The Trustees have at various times appropriated three,
five, ten, and fifteen hundred dollars for general grading and
improving of the grounds. The grading about Walker Hall
cost one thousand five hundred dollars, and all that was done at
the time, including the avenue in front, cost four thousand dollars.

Ten thousand dollars is probably not an extravagant estimate
of the money that has been expended for such purposes. Add
to this the labor that has been given by citizens and volunteered
by students and the expense is swelled to a still larger aggregate.

COLLEGE EDIFICES.

Some account has already been given of each College edifice,
in its place in the History, with more or less of detail of the
process of erection. The following table exhibits in panoramic
review the date and cost of the several buildings, and thus the

CARE OF BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS JANITORS.

The office of Janitor, or Professor of Dust and Ashes, in Amherst
College is a comparatively recent institution which grew
up naturally with the growth of the College, and increased with
its increase till it has become one of our most important offices.
For many years, the buildings and grounds took care of themselves,
were cared for by the spontaneous service of officers and
students like a small and primitive homestead.by the parents and
children, or, more generally, were not cared for at all, or at least
neglected till they became intolerable and then the nuisance was
abated by some special vote and appointment, or perhaps by the
spontaneous action of the students. Sometimes an unsightly
and dilapidated fence which could be endured no longer, disappeared
in a moonlight night by the hands of the students working
under the guidance of a Tutor ; and in due time not in a
hurry, for that would be indecorous not perhaps for some considerable
time, for the College was poor but sooner or later a better
fence took its place. Faculty and students walked in the
mud ankle deep over the College grounds and in front of the
College buildings every spring, till a kind of corduroy pavement
of rough stones was gradually constructed: when this became
intolerable, it was torn up, some of the best students in College
taking part in the process ; and at length it was succeeded gradually
by fine paving-stones about the buildings, and broad, hard
and smooth walks all over the campus. Every spring, for many
years, the students were in the habit of devoting one day to
raking off the chips and clearing up the grounds. All the earlier
terraces, as we have already seen, were the work of the officers
and students. The Treasurer, Dea. Leland, usually ^took
a general oversight and it was very general of the grounds
and buildings. Sometimes a Professor was specially charged
with the care and superintendence. The Professors of Physical
.Science usually had the charge of exhibiting as well as enlarging
the Cabinets. " Phin Warner " as we used to call him, was
the first Professor of Dust and Ashes ; and he was Professor
only in the germ, for he did little more than to take up and
carry out the ashes from the public and private rooms. Simeon
Smith was the first who might perhaps be dignified with the
title of Janitor. He began with sweeping the rooms and halls.
In 1834, we find his name on the Records of the Trustees as appointed
Inspector of the College buildings. He gave only a
limited amount of time to the work and was paid by the day or
the hour for his services. Mr. Smith died July 23, 1842, and so
faithfully and satisfactorily had he done his work, that his loss
was felt to be quite irreparable.

He was succeeded by Josiah Ayers who more than filled the
vacancy, and exalted the place to a regular department, not
to say, a professorship. He was at length known chiefly as
Prof. Ayers. He was Janitor and kept the keys of public
rooms. He was repairer as well as inspector of buildings. He
had charge of that delicate and difficult matter, the drawing
and occupying of rooms by students. In short, all out-of-door
affairs and everything which no one else could or would do, was
devolved on him. Yet his salary was never more than three
hundred dollars. Mr. Ayers was Selectman, member of the Legislature,
deacon of the Church, superintendent of the Sabbath
School and in all respects a leading citizen. Beloved by officers
and students, respected by neighbors and acquaintances and lamented
by relatives and friends, he died August 4, I860, at the
age of fifty.

He was succeeded by Oliver Hunt who held the office seven
years, from October, 1860, till October, 1867, and who, in the
discharge of his duties, became so familiar with the scientific
collections that he was a skillful guide to the Cabinets, and so
well acquainted with the arrangement of the books that, on the
retirement of Mr. Boltwood, he acted as Assistant Librarian.

On the resignation of Mr. Hunt in 1867, George H. Prince
was appointed Janitor and, if money could have retained him,
would have remained such to this day. But much to the regret
of Faculty and students, he resigned in 1871, and insisted on
the acceptance of his resignation. He is now one of the Selectmen
of Amherst. Sanson Gates is the present Janitor.

Not long after Dr. Stearns came into the presidency, a colored
man who had been for some years a servant in his family, having
married and desiring a home of his own and constant occupation,
became Assistant Janitor, and ere long a house was built
for him in the rear of the President's house, which has now become
one of the College fixtures. His name is Charles Thompson.
Known sometimes as " Tutor Charlie," and sometimes as
''Prof. Charlie," he is one of the most useful and without exception
probably the most popular officer on the College premises.
His portrait may be seen, with the insignia of his office, in the
class-books of all the classes, for the last twelve or fifteen years.

Besides the janitor and his assistant, a third man is now employed
much of the time on the College buildings and grounds.
The College, like other people who live in large houses, is under
the necessity of employing many hands to keep up the establishment.


There was another man, who although he never was officially
janitor or sub-janitor, yet, for a third of a century, sustained a
somewhat similar and no less important relation. He kept in
repair the locks and keys of all the public and private rooms
in College, yes, and of all the trunks, drawers and lockers
in the village. He kept the College clock, and all the other
clocks in town, in running order. He repaired or manufactured
apparatus in all the departments as every Professor had need.
In short, he made whatever no one else could make, repaired
everything that nobodj 7 - else could repair, did everything that
no other mechanic could do, and was the general engineer and
mechanical genius of the town and the College. It is he of whom
Prof. Snell says in his address at the opening of Walker Hall ;
" the old gentleman is to this day very fond of calling me his
apprentice." It will be seen that I refer to Mr. David Parsons.
He was born June 10, 1788, and died June 17, 1872, at the age
of eighty-four. He was living at the opening of Walker^Hall,
living when I wrote the incident of his boyhood in the first
chapter of this History, but died a month or two before it went
to press. The son of Rev. Dr. David Parsons, ,the first President
of the Board of Trustees, he possessed not a little of his
father's genius, and to stand by him and hear him talk as he
was repairing some hopelessly dilapidated clock, or pump, or
piece of apparatus, was as instructive as a lecture, and more
amusing than a comedy.

FUNDS.

The " Fifty Thousand Dollar Charity Fund " was the only
permanent fund of the College for nearly a quarter of a century.
The history of the raising of that fund has been given in one
of our early chapters. I am indebted to Rev. Christopher Gushing,
D. D., the oldest member of the Board of Overseers, and the
Secretary of the Board, for the following history of its growth
and administration.

The first meeting of the Board of Overseers of the Charity
Fund was held August 28, 1822. There were present Rev. Theophilus
Packard, Gen. Salem Towne, Jr., H. Wright Strong,
Esq., and Rev. Thomas Snell. The record designates the fund
as that " upon which is founded the Charity Institution in Amherst.
" Having chosen Lucius Boltwood, Esq., Auditor, and
elected Rev. Samuel Osgood an Overseer, the Board adjourned
" to the day of examination at the close of the next quarter in
Amherst Academy." Thus the Board of Overseers antedates
the College.
Previous to 1824, the income from the fund was applied to
students in the Academy and to those who were in " the Collegiate
Institution " indiscriminately ; but in that year and ever
afterward it was appropriated exclusively to students in " the
Collegiate Institution." The " Charter " is recognized in 1825
and the Charity Institution is called a " College " in 1826.

The Board of Trustees having proposed " so far to alter the
Constitution as to unite at their pleasure the offices of Financier
and Treasurer in one and the same person, the Board of Overseers
. . . voted unanimously to alter said Constitution as proposed,
" August 22, 1826. The name of the financial officer was
changed from Financier to Commissioner in 1842.

In accordance with a suggestion made by the Overseers in
1865, the avails of the Charity Funds have since that date been
made the basis of Ministerial Scholarships, yielding each beneficiary
sixty dollars a year, and to a few beneficiaries a larger
sum. The original amount of the fund was fifty-one thousand
four hundred and four dollars.
[Cf. p. 50.]
By the Constitution and Bylaws
in accordance with which the fund is managed, one-sixth
of the income is required to be added annually to the principal.

It is not known that there has ever been any loss of any portion
of the fund. In tt few instances there has been loss of
interest, while on the other hand there have been some thousands
of dollars of extra interest received through the premium on
gold, and by judicious investments some thousands of dollars
have been realized as "increment" in distinction from income.
Thus the amount of the fund now reaches the sum of seventytwo
thousand dollars. The available income of the fund from
1827 to 1872 inclusive, has been over one hundred and twentysix
thousand dollars. During these forty-six years the entire
expense of taking care of the fund has been something over
ten thousand dollars, and the amount given to students has been
over one hundred and sixteen thousand dollars.

In 1864 the Overseers voted unanimously " That in our opinion
any student who shall be convicted of the vicious habit of
' hazing Freshmen ' should be cut off from all aid from the Charity
Fund." In 1871, the Overseers " Voted, that it is the unanCf.

*  p. 50.
imous opinion of this Board that no student who uses intoxicating
drinks as a beverage, or tobacco in any form, should be
regarded as a suitable person to receive aid from the Charitable
Funds of this College."

Rev. Samuel Osgood, D. D., of Springfield was a member of
the Board thirty-eight years, and Rev. Thomas Snell, D. D..
of North Brookfield, thirty-three years. No other person has
ever been connected with the Board for even twenty-five years.
There have been but two deaths of members during their connection
with the Board.

In 1863 the Board adopted the following minute : 'WThe
Board of Overseers of the Charity Fund of Amherst College,
recognizing the providence of God in the removal of one of their
number by death, record with gratitude the remarkable fact,
that during the forty-two years of the existence of this Board
there has never, until this year, been any instance of death
among its members.

"And whereas the late Hon. Ithamar Conkey, who held a seat
as a member of this Board sixteen years, during which time he
was never absent from the annual meeting, except in a single
instance, and who presided as Chairman of the Board for fourteen
years, has been removed from us by the hand of God, we
would also express our appreciation of the punctuality, accuracy,
courtesy, integrity and Christian character of our departed
brother, and our sympathy with the bereaved family in this
afflictive providence."

In 1870 the Board adopted the following : " Whereas our
esteemed associate, the Hon. Edward South worth, since our last
meeting, in the providence of God, has been removed from us
by death, we would record our appreciation of his financial skill,
his cultured manners, and his strict integrity remembering his
high standard as to the responsibilities of a fiduciary trust, and
his grateful companionship, we mourn his loss."

The Secretaries of the Board have been as follows : Rev.
Thomas Snell, D. D., 1822-36, fifteen years ; Rev. Cyrus Mann,
1837-38, two years ; Thomas Bond, Esq., 1839-46, eight years;
Hon. William Hyde, 1847-57, eleven years ; Rev. Christopher
dishing, 1858-.
The following is the list of Auditors with their terms of service
: Lucius Boltwood, Esq., 1822-33, twelve years ; Rev.
Samuel Ware, 1833-55, twenty-two years ; Moses B. Green, A.
B., 1855-65, ten years ; Rodolphus B. Hubbard, A. M., 1866-69,
four years ; George Montague, Esq., 1870-.

Only one Auditor has died in office.

In 1866 the Board voted, " That, as in the providence of God
the Auditor of this Board, Moses B. Green, Esq., has been removed
by death, we would record our appreciation of his faithfulness
in the discharge of his official duties, and our affectionate
remembrance of his many gentle and amiable virtues."

The donors and dates of the other funds which, with the exception
of the Sears, have all been founded under the presidencies
of Dr. Hitchcock and Dr. Stearns, may be seen in the
chapters on their administrations. The following statement of
the Treasurer, Hon. Edward Dickinson, exhibits the present
amount of the cash funds of the College, as estimated in round
numbers, and classified under several heads, together with the
estimated annual income and expenditure :

CASH FUNDS OF AMHERST COLLEGE, INDEPENDENT . OF CONTRIBUTIONS

FOR BUILDINGS.

Funds whose income is available for the payment of salaries and

other current expenses, $250,000

Scholarships, 50,000

Hitchcock donation for Scholarships and kindred objects, . . . 100,000

Library, 43,000

Bonds of State of Virginia, unavailable at present, 40,000

Miscellaneous specific appropriations, 40,000

Charity Fund, 72,000

$595,000

Estimated income of funds for general expenses, $22,000

Estimated income of Students' College bills, 28.000

$50,000

Estimated expenses, salaries, etc., $54,000

Estimated deficiency for current year, $4.000

The entire property of the College, including buildings,
grounds, collections, etc., as well as cash funds, is estimated
in round numbers at over a million of dollars.
Beginning with a few theological and miscellaneous books,
presented chiefly by ministers, collected in a chamber at Mrs.
Montague's and deposited first in a single case in the entry of
South College, then on a few shelves in a room in Middle College,
the Library of Amherst College first had a local habitation,
called the Library, in the third story of the Chapel building in
1827, and it was not till 1853 that the present Library buflxling
was erected expressly and exclusively for its use. The architect
calculated that the shelves of the principal story, without
the basement, would contain forty thousand volumes, which
was thought to be all the accommodation that would be needed
for fifty years. The Library now numbers about twenty-seven
thousand volumes, and it not only fills to overflowing the principal
story, but having displaced the reading-room
[The reading-room, containing the principal American and foreign quarterlies,
and some of the magazines, is now accommodated on the floor of the upper hall, or
Library proper. Besides this the students have a reading-room, containing the
newspapers, in North College.]
and the
Trustees' room, is now fast filling the " lower hall " or basement,
and in a very few years will require an addition, or a new
building. Dependent the first twenty years, or more, on subscriptions,
or special appropriations from the general treasury,
it now has permanent funds and an annual income which, the
year past, has been nearly two thousand dollars, and which, by
the conditions of the Sears Fund, is continually increasing.

Prof. Estabrook was the first Librarian from 1821 to
1823. Tutor Clapp then had charge of it for one year. Prof.
Worcester was Librarian from 1824 till 1827. Prof. Snell held
the office from 1827 to 1852 a quarter of a century ! His
salary was forty dollars ! ! At the close of his term of office the
Library contained only about ten thousand volumes, had no
printed or classified catalogue, was opened only once a week for
drawing books, and furnished no facilities for reference or reading
in the room.
With the prospect of a new building and a more rapid increase
of books, the Library seemed to require the time and services
of a Librarian. Lucius Manlius Bolt wood was appointed to
the office in 1852, and held it for eleven years, during which
time the books were arranged and shelved in the new buildings,
catalogued anew and more perfectly, and nearly doubled in number.
The first printed catalogue was published in 1855, and
contained about twelve thousand volumes. The card catalogue
was also commenced by Mr. Boltwood.

The present Librarian, Prof. William L. Montague, who was
appointed in 1864, has prepared a complete card catalogue of
authors alphabetically arranged, a manuscript catalogue of all
the books classified according to departments and subjects, and
a continuation of Poole's Index to the principal quarterlies in
the Library, printed a new catalogue of additions containing
more than fourteen thousand three hundred volumes, and devised
and put in execution a plan for utilizing the whole building
so as to supersede for the present the necessity of a new edifice.
All that can be done for the Library by a Librarian who is at the
same time a Professor charged with the care of a department in
the College, has been done by Prof. Montague. But one of the
most imperative wants of the College now is a Librarian who with
all the learning, culture, Weight of character and personal interest
of a Professor, should give his whole time to the Library,
especially in the way of making it in the largest measure available
for the use of the Faculty and students.

The following statistics, furnished by the Librarian, will be
interesting to some of our readers, and may furnish a standard
of comparison for future times :

Number of volumes in catalogue, July, 1871, 26,300

Number in foreign languages, ancient and modern, 4,600

Ancient classics, . 1,700

Modern European languages, 2,800

Oriental, 100

Scientific, 4,000

Annual increase of the Library, 800

Annual increase of American books, 344

Annual increase of foreign books, 456

Annual increase by purchase, 600
Annual increase by donation, 200

Number of persons who use the Library, 300

Number of books taken out each week, 216

Average weekly number of readers in the Library, 80

Average weekly number of books consulted or read, 175

Annual expense of care of the Library, $1,200

In estimating this last item, only about five hundred dollars
of Prof. Montague's salary is charged to the Library. The remainder
is paid to two students who serve as his assistants.

LABORATORY AND CABINETS.

^

The Chemical Laboratory was born in 1822, I believe, in one
of the lower rooms in South College was cradled, together
with Physics, Philosophy, Rhetoric, Religion and I know not
how many other nurselings, in that marvelous phalanstery, so
humorously described by President Humphrey, and Dr. Hitchcock,
in the fourth story south entry of North College attained
its majority in the cellar or basement at the west end
of the Chapel building, and now in its mature manhood, it has
spread itself and taken entire and exclusive possession of the
first floor in Williston Hall. Alumni who return to visit the
old homestead find more difficulty in recognizing in the fullgrown
man a single feature of the infa'nt, the child or the youth
with whom they were acquainted in their College days, than
they do in recognizing each other after an absence of a quarter
or half a century. The most novel and characteristic feature
of the new Laboratory in Williston Hall is the working-room
furnished with tables, bowls, blow-pipes, etc., etc., which are
kept in almost constant use, not unfrequently in vacation as
well as term-time, by students in analytic chemistry.

The history of the " Philosophical Cabinet," as we used to
call Prof. Snell's apparatus for the illustration of physics and
the room in which it was contained, was given by the Professor
himself at the opening of "Walker Hall, better than it can be
given by anybody else. There is no fault to be found with it
except that with characteristic modesty " the half has not been
told." We copy it almost entire :

" Soon after Amherst College was opened for the reception
of students, in September, 1821, a few second-hand articles of
English apparatus were purchased of Dr. Prince of Salem.
These were, a set of simple machines, a small air-pump, an electrical
machine, a compound microscope, a solar microscope, a
magic-lantern, and a limited number of small articles to accompany
them. There was also a pair of globes, and a small
Gregorian telescope. The collection had probably done long
service elsewhere ; and some of the articles were much worn.
The air-pump was especially infirm, and would generally fail
before a lecture was closed, unable to draw another breath.

" When the North College was erected, in 1822, the southern
half of the fourth story was devoted to public uses. The space
now occupied by the entry and corner-rooms was used for a
Chapel. The back middle-room contained the College Library ;
and the front middle, the apparatus both in natural philosophy
and chemistry ; and lectures in both of these departments, indeed
on all subjects, were given in the Chapel, the simple pulpit
at the west end serving as a lecturing-desk.

" Prof. Olds, the first incumbent of the chair of natural philosophy,
and Prof. Jacob Abbott, his successor, had only the
meagre collection already described with which to illustrate the
principles of the science. In 1831, Prof. Hovey, the successor
of Prof. Abbott, visited Europe for his health ; and the opportunity
was seized upon by the friends of the College to solicit
contributions, and to commission the Professor to purchase
books for the Library, and apparatus for the scientific departments.
I think, about four thousand dollars were raised for
these purposes. The principal part of the philosophical cabinet
was procured of Pixii of Paris, and cost somewhat less than two
thousand dollars.

" The Chapel building which had been erected in 1826, between
the North and South Colleges, had a room appropriated
to the uses of the philosophical apparatus ; and the few articles
first purchased of Dr. Prince had been placed in it. Previous
to the purchases made by Prof. Hovey, all the instruments belonging
to the department were accommodated on one wide
shelf extending half round that room. After the new apparatus
had arrived, and before Prof. Hovey's return, the whole was
unpacked, and the parts put together at my own house, where
it stood in two unoccupied rooms till cases could be erected for
it in the room of the chapel building. From 1827 to 1870, a
period of forty-three years, this collection of instruments has
been kept in the same room, new cases having been repeatedly
added as they were needed ; but for the last eight or ten years
the cases have become so crowded, that, when a new article was
wanted, the first question to be answered was, " Is there any
room for it ? " And this want of space for the safe and convenient
accommodation of new instruments has of late been a
serious difficulty in the way of increasing the collection. >. In
quantity, and, as I think, in real utility, it is now just about
double of what it was immediately after the purchases were
made in 1831.

" It may not be improper for me to state in what way this
increase has been made. But let me premise, that, for a few
years after Prof. Hovey's purchases, the philosophical apparatus
of Amherst College had a high reputation. It was extensive
for that day ; and the articles, mostly of French construction,
were very neat and beautiful when compared with the old and
heavy English instruments which were to be found in most of
the Colleges. Professors from several Institutions came to examine
it; and the establishment of Pixii received not a few
large orders from the United States in consequence of the example
set by this College.

" Every department of knowledge, however, is progressive.
Whatever completeness the appliances for giving instruction
may possess this year, they will be found deficient the next.
Hence I very soon found it necessary to furnish myself with additional
pieces, either for the illustration of newly-discovered
facts and principles, or for the more perfect presentation of those
already known. But how should this be done ? The College
was poor, and the money already expended had been begged
from friends who supposed they had set her up for a life-time.
It would not do to apply to them again so soon. Of course, the
College must appropriate a little to the several departments in
order to keep things in repair. The problem was, how with
that little (which for this department did not, for a considerable
time, exceed twenty-five dollars a year), how with that
small sum, to preserve the apparatus in a decent condition in
spite of wear and accident, and also to make occasional additions
and improvements.

" With all my want of qualifications for my position, of which
none can be so fully aware as myself, I found one thing greatly
in my favor. I was born a Yankee, and from childhood had
been fond of whittling. The Department of Natural Philosophy
gave me the opportunity of indulging in this kind of recreation.
Before I could afford to buy tools, or fit up a shop I begged the
use of both from my worthy friend Mr. David Parsons, who is
a most skillful mechanic himself, and who gave me gratuitously
a multitude of valuable hints. The old gentleman is to this day
very fond of calling me his apprentice. The Department of Natural
Philosophy in Amherst College owes not a little, both directly
and indirectly, to the skill and kindness of Mr. Parsons.
By slow degrees I procured tools for myself, and at length set
up shop in the rear part of my house, where, during each of
the last thirty years, I have done more or less of mechanical
work. I have repaired instruments which needed repair; a
considerable number I improved, so that they serve their purposes
better, or else answer another purpose beside that for
which they were originally designed ; and not a few I have
wholly made, either from published descriptions, or from designs
of my own.

44 The most valuable article which my private workshop
now contains is not my own, but belongs to the College. It
is an engine lathe, turned by the foot ; and was given by
James T. Ames, Esq., of Chicopee, for the benefit of the department.


" The average appropriation to the Department of Natural
Philosophy from 1828 to 1869 has been about sixty-five dollars
per year, a sum which could hardly be expected to do more
than keep the apparatus in tolerable repair. And yet, as I have
already said, this annual allowance has served to double the
value of the collection.

" Now that the collection is to occupy a spacious and handsome
apartment, I trust the Walker funds will avail to replace
many cheap-looking instruments by more comely and fitting
ones, as well as to add a number of others which I have for
some time wished to procure, but which the former room was
not large enough to accommodate, nor the resources of the department
sufficient to purchase."

The history of the " Natural History Cabinets " for the first
' forty years and more occupies thirty pages of Dr. Hitchcock's
" Reminiscences of Amherst College." It is the most fascinating
portion of the book, and one of the most charming specimens
of autobiography blended with history that can be found in
modern literature. How the nucleus was formed by the unipn
of his own private collection of a few hundred specimens with
one already begun by the Natural History Society which he
found here in 1826, the larger part of both which collections,
he playfully remarks, would probably come under the title of
jactalites or specimens to be thrown away how this was increased
by his own collections when he was making the geological
survey of Massachusetts, and by contributions from graduates,
especially foreign missionaries how further accessions were
made by bequests of Prof. Hovey, by donations from Prof.
Shepard and Prof. Adams, by exchange and purchase from
European collections, and by contributions from the classes,
such for example as the huge bowlder weighing over eight tons
which the Class of '57 transported half a mile and placed, where
it now lies, in front of Woods Cabinet the sympathizing description
of the origin and progress of the Shepard and the
Adams Cabinets and his admiring notices of the men who created
them and above all that romantic history of the Ichnological
Cabinet begun in 1835 with the Greenfield " turkey
tracks," and the South Hadley " tracks of poultry " or of
" Noah's raven " and continued with the ridicule or the pity of
the masses and the opposition of men of science generally, but
with the sympathy and support of a few " noble " and " eminent"
savants, and the pecuniary aid of not a few generous personal
friends and friends of the College, till at length Ichnology
was recognized as an established science, and the Appleton Cabinet
became a geological or palseontological Mecca, the resort of
scientific pilgrims from all lands all this forms a history of
unique and unsurpassed interest which, to be appreciated, must
be read, as it is narrated by him who was at once the author
of the book and the founder of the Cabinets, in his inimitable
autobiography. Not the least entertaining passages in the narratives
are those in which he reports the comments of the bystanders
as they witnessed his enthusiasm in making these collections
such as these, for example :

" After the auction at Greenfield, I employed a wagoner to
transport my specimens to the railroad. I happened to be a
little out of sight and heard him describing to a citizen, standing
by, the sums I had paid for them. ' The man,' said the citizen,
' who will waste money like that, should have a guardian
placed over him.'

" A large crowd had gathered when I took the first cast, and
I was told afterwards that all which saved me from being voted
a fit subject for a lunatic asylum, was the testimony of a young
lady, in one of the adjoining houses, who had attended my lectures
on geology at Amherst, and who testified that I was no
more deranged than such men usually are."

[Uncited footnote: Of tracks on the sidewalks of Greenwich street in New York City.]

Another thing with which one cannot but be struck in reading
Dr. Hitchcock's Reminiscences of his Cabinets, and also in
visiting the Cabinets themselves, is the pains he has taken to
perpetuate the name of every contributor whether of money, or
of specimens, however small the contribution may have been.
He had a good memory, the memory of a grateful heart ; and it
will not be his fault, if the donors to his Cabinets are not held
in everlasting remembrance.

The Conchological and the Ichnological collections remain
to this day very much as they were left by the respective founders
at the time of their death, the former reminding one of a
book suddenly interrupted by the death of its author which
must remain forever unfinished the latter suggesting those
Cyclopean foundations at Baalbec whose builders were arrested
by some mysterious cause and those who came after them never
even attempted to complete the edifice. The Hitchcock Ichnological
Cabinet, however, is much more than a foundation it is
probably a pretty complete collection of the principal genera and

species as they exist in the sandstone of the Connecticut Valley,
and the proper work of his successors will be not so much to
add to the collections, as to study and interpret them in the
light of advancing science in future ages.

The Zoological Museum has received many valuable additions
within the last ten years, especially in the department of Comparative
Osteology to which Prof. Edward Hitchcock, Jr., has
given especial attention. Indeed the Gorilla, the Megatherium,
most of the skeletons and stuffed skins of quadrupeds, and the
greater part of the specimens which now attract chief attention
in the upper story of the Appleton Cabinet have been added
during this period. The following memorandum of Prof. Hitchcock
will indicate the sources from which these additions have
chiefly come : " Friends have given me within five years five
hundred and ninety-five dollars and fifty-four cents to buy specimens
in Comparative Osteology. From 1859 to 1865, the Trustees
appropriated three hundred dollars each year, most of which
was expended in new specimens for the Zoological Cabinet.
Since then they have appropriated about one hundred and seventy-
five dollars per annum for the same purpose. In addition
we have had contributions from various sources which, I estimate,
will average two hundred and fifty dollars a year. Of
this our graduate foreign missionaries have furnished at least
one-half." Some of the rarest and finest specimens have been
given by Rev. William Walker and Rev. Josiah Tyler, missionaries
to Western and Southern Africa. The greater part of
these contributions were received in response to a circular addressed
by Prof. Hitchcock to the Alumni, in which such contributions
were invited.

The following brief history of- the origin and progress of the
Shepard Cabinet, and the means and processes of its growth, has
been furnished at my request by the Professor himself:

" My Mineralogical Cabinet was commenced at the age of fifteen,
while a member of the Providence Grammar School ; and
was brought with me when I left Brown University to join the
Sophomore Class, of Amherst Institution, in 1821. An early
visit after my arrival here to the Tourmaline, and other localities
of Chesterfield and Goshen served to increase my eagerness
as a collector, and at the same time placed me in possession of
abundant materials for exchange. In 1823, my identification of
the previously supposed white augite of Goshen, with the species
Spodumene gave me confidence in the study of minerals,
while it increased my stock of specimens desirable to mineralogists.
The exchange I then carried on with the Austrian Consul-
General, Baron von Lederer, in behalf of his own collection
and that of the Imperial Cabinet of Vienna, rapidly enriched
my little museum in foreign minerals. Indeed, from the first, it
was sufficiently ample to serve a useful purpose in the instruction
of beginners ; and was the sole resource of Prof. Amos
Eaton in the lectures he gave during two seasons, before the
students of the Institution.

On leaving College, I resided a year partly in Cambridge
and partly in Boston, during which period I profited much in
extending my collections through visits to new localities in
Eastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and still more, by exchanges
with Prof. Nuttall and other active cultivators of Mineralogy
in the region. I soon after made a very successful tour
into Maine, where at Paris, I was the fortunate discoverer of
the most remarkable green and red Tourmalines then known.
With some of these I made profitable exchanges with the British
Museum and other large collections. My association in 1828
with Prof. Silliman as his assistant, and afterwards with the
College as a lecturer on Natural Science for many years, afforded
me unusual facilities for the extension of my Cabinet. All the
best localities of Connecticut were frequently visited, specimens
of rare interest secured, and the means of supplying scientific
correspondents abundantly obtained. These objects were still
further effected by journeys into adjoining States and the Canadas,
until 1835, when I became Professor of Chemistry in the
Medical College of the State of South Carolina, where a new
and very ample field was opened for the extension of my collections.
From that time to the present, with the exception of
the period of the civil war, I have passed nearly the half of
each year in the South, and been engaged to a considerable extent
in scientific and mining explorations, which have resulted
in varied and rich contributions to my Cabinet. These travels
have also embraced the Western, or Mississippi States, attended
by similar results. But most of all, have I gained by frequent
excursions to the Old World, having since 1839 twelve times
visited Europe, where my exchanges and purchases of specimens
have been conducted on a scale, I am led to believe, not
surpassed by any of my countrymen. Numbers, however, have
never been my aim in these acquisitions. I have rather sought
what was characteristic and instructive, not however to the neglect
of the rare and beautiful.

" Thus far I have had the mineralogical collection in mind in
this narrative of its origin and growth. It may be added that the
augmentation of my Geological Cabinet has for the last twenty
years kept pace with that of my minerals. That is especially
remarkable for fossil remains, characteristic of the leading geologic
formations, beginning with the Silurian and coming down
to the Post Pliocene. While it is well supplied with specimens
of foreign origin, particularly- from Great Britain, Germany and
France, it is not too much perhaps to claim, that its representation
of southern Post Pliocene is one of the most complete hitherto
made, including as it does large portions of two very interesting
Mastodons and a profusion of fossil fish teeth, the result
of uncommon opportunities for collecting afforded through a
long residence of myself and son in South Carolina.

" Of the meteoric collection, now the fourth in extent and value
known, it may be observed that its formation commenced in
1828, in my examination and analysis of the Richmond meteorite
; and it is wanting in very few authentic localities belonging
to this continent that have been described since that date. To
obtain these acquisitions, it has often been necessary to employ
considerable sums of money for their purchase ; but portions of
the material thus acquired have been advantageously employed
in exchanges with foreign cabinets for the supply of distant
localities in no other way obtainable.

" The removal of these collections from New Haven to Amherst
in 1847 was the result of an understanding entered into between
President Hitchcock and myself, that if the College would
cause a fire-proof building to be erected for their reception, I
would deposit them therein, at least for a term of years, and
with the hope, through arrangements afterwards to be made, of
leaving them with the College as a permanent possession. Such
a building was provided in the Woods Cabinet ; and more recently,
the conditions for the purchase of the collections have
been agreed upon, which if faithfully complied with, will consummate
the original plan.

" On the transfer of the mineralogical collection to the new
rooms in the Walker building, the whole of the space formerly
occupied by the entire collection in the second story of the
Woods Cabinet is now devoted to the Geological and Meteoric
Cabinets; and such has been their recent growth, the room
thus afforded is found barely sufficient for their present accommodation.


"The labor in which I am at present occupied is the more
perfect arrangement and cataloguing of the three collections
a work of much labor, and not likely to be completed short of
one or two years."

FACULTY, STUDENTS, SALARIES, BILLS AND OTHER EXPENSES.

In 1821-2, the first year of the existence of the College, the
Faculty consisted of four persons, the President, two Professors
and one Tutor. At the close of the half century, the Faculty
numbered twenty, viz. : the President, thirteen Professors, three
Lecturers and three Instructors. The number of students whose
names appear on the first Catalogue issued in May, 1822, was
fifty-nine, viz. : three Seniors, six Juniors, nineteen Sophomores
and thirty-one Freshmen. The number of students at the time
of the semi-centennial was two hundred and sixty-one, viz. :
sixty-five Seniors, forty-nine Juniors, seventy-six Sophomores
and seventy-one Freshmen. The term-bills at the beginning
were about thirty-one dollars and fifty cents a year ; at the end
of the half century they had risen to about one hundred dollars
a year. Then board cost seventy-five cents a week in clubs, and
from one dollar to one dollar and twenty-five cents in families ;
now it averages about three dollars and fifty cents in clubs and
about five dollars in families. Then wood was from one dollar
and fifty cents to two dollars a cord, and washing " from twelve
to 'twenty cents a week;" now wood is from six dollars and
40
fifty cents to nine dollars a cord ; and washing from fifty to seventy-
five cents a dozen. The expenses which students impose
upon themselves for Societies, Class-day and Commencement,
music, boating, and amusements have risen in far greater proportion.
Then the President's salary was twelve hundred dollars,
that of a Professor eight hundred, and that of a Tutor
four hundred ; now the President's salary is thirty-two hundred
dollars,
[With the perquisites.]
a Professor's twenty-five hundred, and an Instructor's
twelve hundred and fifty. Then the Treasurer's salary was
three hundred dollars, now it is two thousand.

My esteemed colleague, Prof. Edward Hitchcock, has examined
with great care the statistics of the College for each year
of the half century and exhibited the result in tables which he
has kindly furnished me for the readers of this history. The
accompanying chart, also prepared by him, illustrates the same
by a diagram which presents to the eye a comparative view
of the state of the College through the half century. The
industry and ingenuity which these illustrations exhibit, can
hardly fail to suggest to our readers that the author of them is
a chip of the old block and deserves the name he bears.
[This ingenuity proved to be too much for the printer, and the diagram, as
printed, is shorn of its most striking features.]

SOCIETIES.

The history of the " Literary Societies " of Amherst runs parallel
with the history of the College and forms no unimportant
part of it. For the first five or six years, first by allotment and
then by elective affinity, all the students of College, fell into the
Alexandrian or the Athenian Society as naturally and spontaneously
as all the citizens of a town or of the country fall into one
or the other of two great parties. And the members of the
Societies no more thought of being absent from "the weekly
meetings than a good citizen would absent himself from the
polls ; and when at length absences did sometimes occur, the
Societies did not hesitate to impose fines on the delinquents, and
collect them too, just as, in the good old times of the Athenian
republic, the laws imposed a penalty on citizens who took neither
side in affairs of state. " The rivalry between the Alexandrian
and Athenian Societies in the first two years of their history,"
writes Rev. Mr. Packard of the Class of '23, " was earnest, active,
shrewd but friendly and pleasant. I regard these Societies
to have been more beneficial to their members in writing, declamation
and debate, than all the College exercises in these departments.
" In 1823, the Societies transferred their meetings
from the South to the then new North College, and held them,
one in the " Chapel " in the fourth story of the South entry,
and the other in the " Sophomore Recitation Room," No. 3 of
South entry, occupying the rooms alternately each for a term
as the Chapel was the more desirable room of the two. In 1825,
a misunderstanding arose in regard to the occupancy of the
Chapel, both claimed it and "rushed" in to pre-occupy it, both
Presidents took the chair side by side in the desk, both Secretaries
read their records at the same time, appointees from both
Societies began and continued to declaim together in short a
scene was enacted very much like that which attended the "rupture
" of the Presbyterian Church of the United States ten years
later, and with a similar result. The Alexandrian Society withdrew
from the " United Fraternity " a union which had hitherto
made the two Societies substantially one in regard to the
use of their libraries, the holding of joint exhibitions and occasional
meetings, and some other purposes the allotment system
was broken up, and the two Societies entered upon a new era
of fierce and not always friendly rivalry, in which every member
esteemed it his first duty to labor and spend and be spent
for his Society.

On the completion of the new Chapel building in 1827, the
Faculty proposed to the two Societies to bring their libraries
into the room which had been prepared for the College Libraries.
To this proposal, the Athenian Society and a majority of
the Alexandrian acceded, and the three libraries were brought
together in the new room now divided into numbers nine and
ten over the small Chapel. But about two-fifths of the Alexandrians
and a few of the Athenians opposed, discussed and remonstrated,
and when all their opposition proved unavailing,
they withdrew and formed a new Society, the Social Union.
This was a secret Society, and so contagious was this new principle
of secrecy, that it soon extended to the old Societies, and
they were all secret Societies till, some ten or a dozen years
later, one after another, they all abolished the secrecy. The
triangular fight which followed the formation of a third Society,
now raged more fiercely than the duel which preceded it. The
contest for the superiority in numbers ran so high that the Faculty
were obliged to interfere and enforce again a system of
equal allotment. The rivalry showed itself in liberal contributions,
often beyond the means of the members, ten, twenty,
thirty, forty, fifty dollars apiece for the increase of the libraries.
Loyalty, zeal, devotion to the Society became a passion.
This was emphatically true, as might have been expected, of the
new Society, the Social Union ; and the others, in self-defence,
if for no other reason, could not lag far behind. All the Societies
reaped the incidental benefit. This was undoubtedly, as we
have elsewhere styled it, the golden age of the Literary Societies.
That age lasted until the diminished number of students
and the increasing and overmastering influence of another class
of Societies conspired to thin their ranks and weaken their resources,
and at length necessitated or seemed to necessitate the
reduction of the three Societies into two : thus it passed gradually
away never again to return.

The rise of the new Greek Letter Fraternities has obscured
the light and glory of the old Literary Societies in nearly all
the Colleges. In Yale College, the Linonian and the Brothers
which, like rival queens, reigned in the hearts of so many generations
of students, have thus been extinguished. We trust a
better destiny awaits the Alexandrian and Athenian Societies.
We cannot but hope, that the Societies will live as long as the
College itself, and that the names, so happily selected at the
very beginning, and hallowed already in the memories and the
affections of the larger part of the Alumni for half a century,
may only grow brighter with the lapse of time through generations
and ages yet to come.

The Society of Inquiry has existed, with unchanged organization,
and with only unimportant changes of name, longer than
any other Society in Amherst College. Beginning with the
opening term of the College itself, it counts in the roll of its
members the leading ministers and missionaries of all the classes.
By its regular meetings and discussions, by its correspondence
with missionaries in foreign lands, by its care of the Missionary
Concert and of the religious state and statistics of the College,
and more than all perhaps by its almost uninterrupted succession
of annual addresses from distinguished orators and divines for
half a century, it has exerted an important Christian influence
and deserves to be reckoned among the most sacred and venerable
names in our history.

Another " clarum et venerabile nomen" in the early history
of Amherst was the Lutheran Society, an association for the
cultivation of sacred music, much cherished by the students,
and not less fostered by the Faculty, which was only revived,
or reorganized, under another name, in the Beethoven Society.

Next to the anti-slavery excitement, perhaps no question so
agitated several successive generations of students as that in
dispute between the secret and anti-secret Societies. We cannot
go into the history. It has come up incidentally in former chapters.
Dr. Hitchcock has well described the causes of the excitement,
its effects on the College and the action of the Faculty
in regard to it.
[Reminiscences, pp. 320-6.]
The excitement has now nearly, if not quite
passed away. Perhaps the greatest evil now connected with
these Societies is the expense which they involve. They are
also peculiarly exposed to the temptation to conviviality which
so easily besets the young men of these days, although it is believed
that the secret Societies of Amherst are less convivial and
more literary than they are in most of the Colleges.

Amherst has been fruitful in Societies of every name and kind,
too various to be described in these pages, and almost too many
to be numbered. Those of our readers who would gratify their
curiosity or refresh their memory in regard to them, will find
much in which they will be interested in the racy and spicy little
volume, entitled "Student Life in Amherst," which Mr. George
R. Cutting of '71, gave to the Alumni public at the Semi-Centennial
Jubilee. Mr. Cutting has searched records, newspapers and
original sources of every kind with praiseworthy diligence, and
brought out a mass of curious and entertaining matter, at which
I have sometimes been surprised, and which I have not hesitated
to use when it has suited my purpose, for I helped him in



his work with the distinct understanding that I should be at
liberty thus to use him in mine. In default of space for any
detailed history of Amherst Societies, I subjoin a list of the principal
names and dates, not doubting that the bare names will be
the key-notes to whole strains of various music in the memories
of my readers. The list marks the beginning and the end of
each Society, as the accessus and the exitus of College officers
are marked in the triennials. The Societies are arranged chronologically
but in groups according to their kinds.

The Society of the Alumni,



There was an Alumni Association prior to 1842. But it consisted
only of the better scholars elected from the graduates,
and was of short duration. The present Society of Alumni embraces
all graduates of Amherst without distinction. Prof. B.
B. Edwards was its father, its first President, and its first Orator
elect, although the pressure of other duties prevented his
performing this last office. Rev. Theophilus Packard, Jr., was
President of the Society from 1844 to 1851, and Prof. Joseph
Haven from 1851 to 1858. Since then " one term," and that

for one year, has become the rule, and the succession of Presidents
has been as follows: Hon. Henry Morris in 1858; Hon. Simeon
Nash,. 1859 ; Hon. Horace Maynard, 1860 ; Rev. Jonathan Brace,
D. D., 1861; Hon. A. H. Bullock, 1862; Hon. James Humphrey,
1863; Hon. G. A. Grow, 1864; Hon. E. H. Kellogg,

1869 ; Hon. A. B. Ely, 1870 ; Hon. A. H. Bullock, 1871 ; Rev.
H. M. Storrs, D. D., 1872.

Prof. Snell was Secretary and Treasurer of the Society from
1842 till 1851 ; Prof. Adams, the next two years, that is, till his
death in 1852 ; Prof. Clark, from 1853 till 1858 ; and Prof.
Seelye from that date till the present time. For many years it
was customary to elect each year an Orator and substitute for
the ensuing year. More frequently than otherwise, however,
both Orator and substitute failed. The names of those who fulfilled
their appointments will be found with others in the list
of Commencement Orators on a subsequent page. Hon. A. H.
Bullock who was President for 1852, made an address on retiring
from the chair in 1863, which was so much more satisfactory
than the customary oration, that it established a precedent or
new custom which has since been followed greatly to the satisfaction
of the Alumni. Obituary notices of deceased Alumni
began to be read before the Society in 1851 by Prof. Tyler who
then gave biographical sketches of all who had deceased during
the three years since the last triennial, and continued to read
such sketches annually till 1858 when he resigned this duty
into the hands of the Librarian, Mr. L. M. Boltwood, who discharged
it till his resignation of the office of Librarian in 1863.
Since that time Prof. Crowell has prepared the obituaries ; and
instead of being read to the Society, they have been printed
and distributed among the members. The Alumni early provided
for the preservation of the obituaries that were not printed,
also, by directing the Secretary to have them carefully copied
in a book which is now kept in the Library.

For many years, the time of the Alumni at their annual meetings
was chiefly taken up with matters of business, and those very
frequently efforts to raise money. Thus the records of several
meetings are chiefly occupied with resolutions, contributions and
names of contributors to the portraits successively of President
Humphrey, Prof. Fiske, and President Hitchcock. These efforts
were entirely successful ; and when Alumni visit the Library and
see there the portraits of these officers, they have the satisfaction
of feeling that they were placed there by voluntary contributions,
generally of one dollar each, by the Alumni themselves.
At their first meeting, in compliance with a suggestion of Dr.
Vaill, the Society inaugurated an effort to endow an Alumni
Professorship. This was followed, at intervals, by successive
efforts to raise fifteen thousand dollars for the Library ; to e^ct
a monument, a hall or some, other memorial of our fallen soldiers
; and to establish class-scholarships, one at least for each
class that graduated previous to the semi-centennial. The first
of these enterprises was an entire failure so far as a complete
endowment of an Alumni Professorship was concerned, although
it doubtless contributed to the success of the General Agent in
his general agency. The second, originating in a donation of a
thousand dollars by Rev. Dr. George C. Shepard of the Class
of '24, failed to raise the amount contemplated, but brought
considerable sums into the treasury of the Society which were
expended by a Committee of the Alumni and made valuable
additions to the Library. The third, as already stated in a
former chapter, has not yet reached its consummation, and it is
too early to say how far it will prove successful. It is now the
aim and endeavor of the officers of the Society to keep its meetings
free from such appeals for money and all mere matters of
business, and consecrate the hour to fraternal greetings, College
memories and wise counsels for the prosperity of Alma Mater ;
and the meetings ha*ve been pleasant and profitable just in proportion
as they have been able to adhere to this policy.

COLLEGE MAGAZINES AND NEWSPAPERS.

The first periodical ever printed in Amherst was The Chemist
and Meteorological Journal, "published every Saturday morning,
John R. Cotting, editor ; printed by Carter & Adams." As the
name imports, it was wholly a scientific journal, without any
department for news. Its editor lectured meanwhile on Chemistry
in Amherst College, but with so little success that his
name appears on no Catalogue. The first number of The Chemist
appeared in July, 1826, and the last in December of the same
year. Thus the paper lasted only six months, but quite long
enough for the pecuniary profit of the printers who lost in it
about all they were then worth. At the time of his death in
1871, Mr. Getting was the State Geologist of Georgia.

In November, 1826, the first number of The New England Inquirer
was issued, by the same printers and publishers, and
edited by Osmyn Baker, since well known as a member of Congress
and Commissioner of the Smith Charities. Mr. Baker,
who was a native of Amherst and then a lawyer in town, edited
only one volume. The second volume was edited by Tutor B.
B. Edwards and Prof. S. M. Worcester, and printed and published
by J. S. & C. Adams a firm known to all the graduates
of Amherst from that day to this. The paper was conducted
with great ability by the editors and much enterprise by the
publishers, but was not a pecuniary success, and at the end
of the second year, in November, 1827, editors and publishers
were fain to relinquish it. Sixteen years elapsed, before any
one ventured to undertake another newspaper in Amherst. In
1844, the Messrs. Adams commenced the publication of The
Hampshire and Franklin Express which, although now under
another name, has been continued till the present time.

The periodical literature of Amherst under-graduates commenced
in 1831 with The Sprite, which was a magazine, published,
somewhat irregularly, about once in two months, and
filled with Sprite-\y tales, romances and productions of the
fancy and the imagination. The present periodical, The Amherst
Student, is a neivspaper, published fortnightly, in term
time, and made up in about equal proportions of the facts
and events of every day occurrence in this and other Colleges,
and criticisms of the government and the course of study, intended
to show what in the opinion of the editors, a College
might be and ought to be, but is not, in this nineteenth century.
A difference sufficiently indicative of change and progress
to satisfy the radical reformer, and truly indicative, in part
at least, of a change that has really come over College minds in
this democratic and matter-of-fact age. The students of the
present day would not cure to read the fine-spun fancies of The
Sprite, and the editors of The Sprite would neither have condescended
to print the plain facts, nor have been permitted by the
Faculty to publish the bold criticisms which fill the pages of The
Student. The periodicals that fill up the interval between these
two extremes The Shrine, The G-uest, The Horce Collegiance,
The Indicator, The Amherst Collegiate Magazine, and The Ichnolite
were all monthlies, and as in the frequency of their issue, so in
their character, they were somewhat intermediate between The
Sprite and The Student, each reflecting more or less the spiri^of
its age and generation, all marking the changes through which the
College was passing, and yet each and all shaped quite as much by
the idiosyncrasies of the individual students who originated them
or conducted them from year to year. Perhaps the chief interest
now in looking over these old periodicals is in noting the names
of the editors and contributors.
[The contributors are anonymous, but the Librarian has entered the names of
very many in the copies preserved in the College Library.]
Among them are not a few of
the most honored names in the Catalogue of our Alumni. And
yet when the editors are obliged to be almost the sole contributors,
as it is said they now are, they pay dearly for their honors.
It is too heavy a tax on their time and strength. We subjoin in
chronological table the entire series of College periodicals :

COMMENCEMENT, CLASS-DAY, ETC.

It is well known to our readers that formerly Commencement
was a holiday, and a high-day, not only for the students and

their friends, and the Alumni of this and other Colleges, but for

O

the uneducated masses not of Amherst merely but of Pelham,
Shutesbury and all the neighboring towns, some of whom filled
the village church with a rush and a jam, while the greater
multitude thronged the streets, clustered about the booths and
stalls on the common, saw the shows -in the tents, listened to
the auctioneers, criers and street orators, or perchance, with
more aspiring mind, visited the public rooms and took in the
view from the tower. Now the spectacles and the spectators
have disappeared together from the common, the rush at the
doors has ceased, and the seats are no longer crowded with cultivated
or uncultivated hearers. This change began with the
change in the time of Commencement, which used to be in August,
or September, when the rural population had finished the
hard work of the Summer and were now ready for a holiday.
Now Commencement comes early in July, and the farmers are in
the midst of their haying and harvesting. But a similar, not to
say a greater change is seen in the Commencements at Cambridge
and Yale and all the other Colleges, and cannot, therefore, be
owing to any mere local or temporary cause. Ordinations also
and conventions, and public occasions generally, no longer draw
such crowds as they did a few years ago. The change is especially
manifest since the war. Possibly the fearful anxiety and
agony of that great conflict may have rendered the popular mind
less susceptible to minor excitements. But the revolution of
which we speak, is doubtless mainly the result of the widening
circulation and growing influence of the newspaper press. People
will not take great pains to attend any ordinary public gathering
when they can read all that was said and done in the daily
newspaper the next morning. As, in ancient times, poetry gave
place to prose when alphabetic writing came into common use, so
oral speech is now waning before written hearing before reading
under the influence of the magazine and the daily newspaper.
The next step in the revolution that is now sweeping over
our American system of collegiate education a step which has
been distinctly announced by the oldest of our New England
Colleges, and is seriously contemplated in more than one College
out of New England will perhaps be to abolish Commencement
itself, or at least all that has come down to us from our fathers,
associated with that venerable name. Amherst College, we hope
and believe, will not be in haste to follow such an example.

One of the most attractive and inspiring exercises of Commencement
week has been the annual Oration, or Address, before
one and another of the College Societies. This usage in
Amherst began almost, or quite, with the beginning of such
societies, and grew with their growth, until it became a prominent
feature of our anniversaries. The Society of Inquiry has
rarely failed to be thus represented annually, and that too by
some of our most learned and eloquent divines. The Literary
Societies have sometimes, (in the days of their early rivalry, )"iiad
two or three rival orators at Commencement, and sometimes,
(especially of late,) had none at all. Usually, however, they
have appeared before the public with one orator each year,
either chosen by the Societies in rotation, or in their united capacity
as a Social Union. Not a few of the foremost orators and
statesmen of the country have been proud to present themselves
at these our Olympic games where educated men and cultured
and refined women gathered in crowds to listen to their orations,
and where large classes of noble and aspiring youth were, stirred
to emulate their wisdom and eloquence, as Thucydides was animated
by the rehearsals of Herodotus, as Demosthenes was inspired
by the eloquence of Callistratus, as Themistocles was
moved by the laurels of Miltiades. For several years the Society
of Alumni, also, brought forward the distinguished sons of the
College in set speeches to instruct and encourage their younger
brothers in the race of life ; and at irregular intervals the Phi
Beta Kappa Society has been fitly represented by some of the
ripest of our American scholars. Some of these orations still
ring in my ears like the distant sound of a trumpet. The very
names of the orators waken memories like Auld Lang Syne.
The list which lies before me, and which I have taken some
pains to collect, though long, is so suggestive that I cannot but
put it on record. Making no distinction as to the society before
which they spoke, the roll is as follows:
[I have not been able to make the list complete for the earlier years. The speakers
are arranged in the order of the years when they spoke, beginning with 1828.]
William B. Calhoun,
John Todd, George Bancroft, G. C. Verplanck, Caleb Gushing,
Albert Barnes, D. D. Barnard, George Shepard, Gov. McDowell,
of Virginia, Gov. Seward, of New York, Gov. Everett, of
Massachusetts, Alexander Everett, B. B. Edwards, Robert E.
Pattison, George Lunt, Thatcher Thayer, Edward Beecher,
Leonard Bacon, Charles Simmer, William Adams, Rufus Choate,
Jonathan Leavitt, Tayler Lewis, James S. Thayer, E. P. Whippie,
J. B. Condit, W. G. T. Shedd, H. W. Beecher, Alvan Bond,
R. S. Storrs, A. H. Bullock, H. B. Smith, E. A. Park, Nehemiah
Cleaveland, Henry Neill, A. L. Stone, C. C. Felton, A. W. McClure,
R. W. Emerson, F. D. Huntington, J. P. Thompson,
Joseph Haven, R. D. Hitchcock, Anson Burlingame,G. A. Grow,
E. B. Foster, Wendell Phillips, Nehemiah Adams, Austin Phelps,
George W. Curtis, Samuel Seelye, Barnas Sears, Horace Maynard,
F. A. March, Daniel S. 'Dickinson, J. M. Manning, O. P.
Lord, J. E. Rockwell, L. P. Hickok, George Thompson, G. S.
Hillard, James McCosh, George P. Loring, A. P. Peabody, J.
L. Diman, J. H. Fairchild, G. N. Webber, N. Mighill, W. Gladden.
Some of these speakers as, for example, Messrs. Beecher,
Hitchcock, Huntington and Storrs have spoken two or three
times, and before different societies. To complete the variety,
John B. Gough addressed the Anti-Venenian Society, or the students
as a body, beginning some twenty years ago, at almost
every successive Commencement for ten years. The educating
power and stimulating influence of one or two, sometimes three
or four such orators as these at every Commencement, can hardly
be overestimated. To lose it were a great loss to the students, to
the College and to the community. Yet the same causes which
have already so reduced the attendance at Commencements,
must, of course, dimmish the inducement and the inclination to
address the Societies on these occasions. There is an increasingdifficulty
every year in obtaining such orators, as once deemed
it an honor and a privilege to appear before the audience that
was wont to gather at these annual festivals. And what is still
more discouraging, it is only an orator of the very highest reputation,
or more likely some speaker who will amuse them and
make them laugh, that now draws any considerable number of
the students themselves, even the members of the Society that
invited him, to listen to his oration. And he goes away perchance
exclaiming, with the prince of Roman orators, O tempora
! O mores ! At this rate, this truly American feature of a
distinctively American Commencement will soon die out, even
before the Commencement itself ceases to drag out a miserable
existence.

Class-day has recently become a prominent and highly attractive
feature of Commencement week. It began with the Class
of 1852 who, at the close of their Senior examination, six weeks
before Commencement, had an Oration and a Poem in the evening,
after which they marched in procession, led by a band of
music and followed by all College and no small part of the toVn,
particularly the town boys, to the houses of the Professors whom
they addressed, through some one appointed for the purpose,
and expected them, volentes nolentes, to make a speech in return.
Then they had a class-supper, which, however, was over, and
the class at their rooms and in their beds long before morning.
Class-day continued to be observed at the beginning of the
Senior vacation, (growing, however, in the number, variety and
interest of the exercises, occupying the afternoon, instead of the
evening, with its public performances and prolonging the class
supper to day-dawn the next morning,) until 1870, when it was
transferred to the week of Commencement, thus suiting the convenience
of the relatives and friends of the class who can now
combine Class day and Commencement in one festival, and at
the same time contributing a charm to the exercises of that
week which compensates in no small measure for the loss of
other attractions.

A noteworthy change has passed over Amherst, in common
with other Colleges and the community generally, in manners
and customs, and especially in regard to recreations and amusements.
Time was, when class-suppers and " convivial entertainments
" were " strictly forbidden " when slave-holding was
deemed comparatively innocent, and dancing a mortal sin
when the ten-pin alley was the broad road to ruin, and the billiard
saloon the very vestibule of perdition when the student
who should have been caught singing such songs as " The way
we have in Old Amherst," and others like it, in the streets,.
would have been expelled, or perchance found himself in the
lock-up. Now the class-supper is the goal and garland of the
College curriculum. Now slave-holding is abolished, and dancing,
like calisthenics, is very generally considered as in itself an
innocent recreation, nay, at proper times and places a graceful
and useful exercise. Now the bowling-alley occupies the lower
floor of the College Gymnasium, and but for want of room and
money it is quite possible that a billiard table might have been
introduced under the same roof, and as a part of the same system
of gymnastic exercises. Now those songs which are such a
strange medley of festive odes and negro melodies, are sung in
the parlors of citizens and Professors. I cannot say that I am
entirely converted either to the ethics or the aesthetics of this
new regime. Still less would I affirm, that negro melodies,
smoking songs, class-suppers, dancing, bowling, billiards et id
genus omne, have been wholly converted and entirely sanctified
to the uses of learning and religion. Nor should it be understood
that all these innovations have received the sanction of the
government, or met the approval of the Faculty and the Trustees.
But I do say as John Wesley said long ago, that it is a
pity the devil should have all the best music, or the best exercise,
recreation and amusement. And we have certainly gone
far in redeeming not a few of these things from their long
desecration, and making them among the most effective means
of bodily and spiritual health, of physical and mental education.
Ten-pins and billiards were the way to perdition, when they
were to be found only with the bar and the saloon in the very
purlieus of the pit, and when the young man rushed madly into
them in opposition to public sentiment, the commands and expostulations
of parents and teachers and the remonstrances of
his own conscience. But students are far less likely, as facts
abundantly prove, to visit drinking and gambling saloons and
the like dens of corruption and pollution, when they can find
the exercise and recreation which they seek, without such surroundings.
And when we compare all these new modes which
distinguish, but in the view of older graduates do not adorn,
recent College life, with those which they have superseded
with the hazing, the fagging, the breaking of windows, the tarring
or freezing up of the bell, the turning of recitation-rooms
into sheep-pens or cow-stables, and above all with the mock
sacraments and prayer-meetings, the " Ho every one that thirsteth
" societies, and the secret orgies which, thirty or forty years
ago, were, too often, the reaction and outbreak from old ideas
and ordinances, but which no student now-a-days would ever
think of perpetrating certainly we cannot deny that, on the
whole, there has been a gain to manners, morals and religion.
When I see the follies and frivolities of students now, I confess
I have sometimes been almost ready to say, that they have degenerated
since I was in College. Yet on reflection I come back
to the conclusion that the difference is chiefly in forms* and
modes of manifestation, that human nature and student nature
is substantially the same in all generations, and that the students
of Amherst College were never more manly, more scholarly or
more Christian, than they are now. Certain I am that the President
and Professors were never so much in the habit of relying
on their sense of honor and right, and never before was there
such a prompt and unfailing response by the whole body of the
students to all our appeals in behalf of whatever things are true,
pure, beautiful and good.

Boating is a new custom in Amherst, and a strange one, which
former generations of students would never have imagined
could be introduced, and in which the students of other Colleges
had no fear of competition from this quarter. " A fresh-water
College," with the river three miles away, its students,
for the most part, " landlubbers," and its Faculty, partly for
these reasons, and partly on general grounds, averse to the experiment,
it never entered the lists till 1869 and then at great
disadvantage. Yet at the third trial in the regatta of 1872
the Amherst boys came off victorious over all competitors, and
made the shortest time on record. The result was a surprise to
themselves and an astonishment to others. Whether it was
owing to the greater average age of Amherst students as The
Yale Courant suggests, to the long and constant practice of the
Gymnasium as the newspapers very generally argue, to better
training, that is, neither over-training, on the one hand, nor, on
the other, neglect of training as the boys themselves say, or, as
their trainer is said to insist, to their morale quite as much and
more than to any physical causes this question is still sub judice,
and we shall not attempt to decide it. One thing is quite
certain. If they would maintain their superiority, they must
not overlook any of these means, least of all that which is emphasized
by their trainer. And if, by the happy union of physical
and moral discipline, they can maintain a well-earned ascendency
if they can, at the same time, keep themselves free
from the betting and drinking and gambling which are now too
conspicuous features of the regatta, and thus help to purify and
elevate the regatta itself, they will have deserved well of the
College and the country, and will win the unanimous suffrages
of the friends of physical, intellectual and moral education.

After all the changes that have come over it during the half
century of its existence, the College still answers well the purpose
which was uppermost in the hearts of its founders. Of
the whole number of Alumni whose names are registered in the
Semi-Centennial Catalogue, viz., nineteen hundred and fortysix,
seven hundred and ninety-nine, or forty-one per cent of
the whole, are registered as ministers. The percentage will, of
course be greater when all the candidates for the ministry in
the recently-graduated classes, have entered the profession. At
the close of Dr. Humphrey's presidency, of seven hundred and
ninety-eight, then the entire number of Alumni, three hundred
and forty, or forty-two per cent, had become ministers ; and at
the close of Dr. Hitchcock's presidency four hundred and seventy-
nine out of ten hundred and ninety-four, or forty-three per
cent, had entered the ministry. The classes that graduated under
President Humphrey, taken by themselves, have furnished
fifty -five per cent of ministers ; those that graduated under President
Hitchcock, forty-three per cent; and the first ten classes
that graduated under President Stearns, leaving out the later
ones as not yet having brought in their full quota, forty per cent.

The Class of '24 has the largest proportion of ministers, viz :
seventy per cent ; the Class of '37 ranks next, having sixtyeight
per cent, and the Class of '43 follows close upon it, having
sixty-seven per cent. Amherst has fallen off in common with
all the other New England Colleges, in the proportion of ministers
to the whole number of graduates. But it has fallen off
less than any other New England College ; and is now furnishing
not only a larger percentage, but a greater number of ministers
than any other College in New England. Indeed, for the
half century, beginning with 1815 and ending with 1865, " Amherst
stands at the head in its percentage of ministers ; and in
the number of ministers which it has furnished during this
period, it is second only to Yale."
[Rev. C. Gushing. See Exercises at the Placing of the Corner-stone of the College
Church.]

The occupations of our Alumni as they are registered in the
Semi-Centennial Catalogue, prepared with great care and labor
by Prof. Crowell, are summed up as follows :

Whole number of Alumni, 1,946

Ordained Ministers, 799

Foreign Missionaries, 79

Physicians, 138

Lawyers, 233

Professors in Colleges and professional Schools, and other. Teachers, 208

Others engaged in Literary or Scientific pursuits, 74

This gives forty-one per cent of all our graduates as ministers,
seven per cent, physicians, twelve per cent, lawyers, and eleven
per cent, teachers. According to recent statistics of the Bureau
of Education, as reported in the newspapers (I am not able to
verify the report) amongHhe graduates of "four New England
Colleges, Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth and Wesleyan, a little more
than twenty-five per cent are ministers, thirty-three per cent,
lawyers, thirteen per cent, physicians, and fourteen per cent,
teachers. Yale has one-third of her graduates in the law and
less than one-quarter in the ministry ; forty per cent of Harvard
men choose law."

The above table of Amherst statistics, it should be added, exhibits
the entire number of ordained ministers and doctors of
medicine, since they have always been distinguished on the Triennial
Catalogue, while the other occupations which are registered
for the first time in the Semi-Centennial Catalogue, are
designated only in cases of living Alumni, so that it does not

show the entire number of lawyers, teachers or other literary
men, nor their full proportion to ministers and physicians. At
the same time the proportion of lawyers and of lay graduates
generally, was comparatively small in the earlier years of the
College. It used to be regarded almost as a matter of course
that a pious student in Amherst College ought to be, and would
be, a minister. Now pious students go into all the professions,
and it is considered desirable it certainly is desirable that they
should ; if they .only carry their Christian principles with them
into the secular professions and the high places of influence in
the State as well as the Church, as we know very many of them
do, it is a result which would gladden the hearts even of those
good men who founded the Institution in prayer and faith chiefly
for the education of ministers.

The Alumni of Amherst adorn every profession. The reverend
clergy outnumber, and, on the whole, perhaps outshine, the other
professions. But our young lawyers and physicians are rapidly
rising to the same high rank in New York and Boston and elsewhere
which our preachers have so long and so conspicuously
held in Brooklyn and more recently taken in other cities. Literature,
also, and science, and theology, count Amherst graduates
among their brightest ornaments. They have carried their
knowledge and culture with them into the high places of agriculture
and manufactures, engineering and machinery, commerce
and business of every kind. The periodical press owns their
sway from Andover to San Francisco, in the Valley of the Connecticut,
on the banks of the Hudson, and on the waters that
flow into the Mississippi. Next to religion, education is perhaps
the sphere in which our College has especially ruled, and her sons
are to be found at the head of Academies and High Schools
without number, from the farthest East to the far West, and officering
Colleges from the Massachusetts Agricultural College in
Amherst to the Syrian College in Beirut and Robert College in
Constantinople ; from the oldest Theological Seminaries in this
country to the most recent schools for the education of native
preachers and teachers in Turkey, India, China and Japan. They
have not often sought distinction in political and public life, but
promotion has sometimes sought them, and they have honored
the Gubernatorial office in Massachusetts and the Speaker's chair
in the Congress of the United States; they have filled and illustrated
some of the highest stations legislative, executive and judicial
in the State and the Nation. Amherst can not boast of
the long line of Presidents, Governors and Cabinet Officers and
Ambassadors to foreign courts that have marched down the generations
and centuries in the history of older Institutions. But
as ambassadors of the King of Kings, as heralds of the Prince
of Peace, as leaders of the sacramental host and pioneers of
Christian civilization, the sons of Amherst may be seen to-day
in every land advancing to the conquest of the world for Christ
and establishing his reign in the hearts of men. Wherever there
is any great battle to be fought, any prolonged and desperate
war to be waged, any hard work to be done at home or abroad,
in civilized or savage lands, for truth and justice, for libert} r and
humanity, for learning and religion there they are sure to be
found doing the hardest of the work, leading in the hottest of
the fight, the true working men in the field of the world, brave
soldiers in the service of the Son of Man and the Son of God.
Such hitherto has been the history of Amherst College such
be her fame and glory in all coming ages.

There was a time when too many Amherst Alumni were disaffected,
not to say, disloyal to their College. That day has gone
by, we trust, never to return. The sons of Amherst are now
proud to call her mother. They gather at the homestead in increasing
numbers and with growing affection at each return
of her anniversary festival. They have organized Societies of
Alumni in the principal cities of. the East and the West live Societies
that meet every winter, and over a good supper, talk of the
past, the present and the future of the College. They advise
students to go to Amherst and send their own sons there unless
there are good and sufficient reasons for sending them elsewhere.
They advocate the claims of their Alma in the newspapers
and plead her cause in the Legislature. The greater part
of the Trustees all the recently elected Trustees, with a single
exception are now graduates; and as soon as the law passed at
the last session of the Legislature, conditioned however on its
acceptance by the Corporation and the Alumni Association, can
receive certain amendments in which both these bodies are
agreed, five members of the Corporation will hereafter forever
be elected directly by the Alumni at their annual meeting. Already
the College is substantially controlled and governed by its
graduates ; in future it will be more and more what they choose
to make it; and with their wealth and influence increasing as
they increase in number and in devotion to its interests, and
with the blessing of heaven on the wise counsels of its guardians
and the faithful labors of its officers, it enters upon the second
half-century of its existence with abundant promise of a
prosperity and usefulness exceeding the most sanguine hopes of
its most hopeful and aspiring founders. At the close of the first
century may those who write its history, find this promise and
prophecy more than fulfilled.
