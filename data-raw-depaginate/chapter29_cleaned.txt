THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR SUBSCRIPTION.  
 
 
B.  
 
SUBSCRIPTION FOR THE COLLEGIATE CHARITY INSTITUTION IN  
 
AMHERST, MASS.  
 
[CO*MONLY CALLED THE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR SUBSCRIPTION.]  
 
JUNE 28, 1822.  
 
Whereas a subscription to the amount of fifty thousand dollars has been obtained  
for the establishment of a permanent fund to be used in the education of pious and  
indigent young men at a Collegiate Charity Institution in Amherst; and,  
 
Whereas the Trustees of Amherst Academy who are entrusted with the manage-  
ment of this fund, have by the aid of other subscriptions and contributions, erected  
a building for the use of said Institution, one hundred feet long and forty feet wide,  
containing thirty-two rooms for the accommodation of students ; and  
 
Whereas the said Trustees have appointed a President, three Professors and a  
Tutor, as instructors in the Institution ; and  
 
Whereas it has been thought expedient to admit into this Institution, not only  
Charity students but others also who are qualified to enter College, and are able to  
pay a reasonable compensation for tuition and room-rent ; and  
 
Whereas the present building is already filled with students about half of whom  
are supported in part by Charity ; and  
 
Whereas to accommodate an increasing number of students, and to give the Insti-  
tution such permanency and respectability that it may rank with the first Colleges  
of New England, it is necessary that additional buildings be erected, and a more  
extensive library and apparatus be provided, and such a fund raised that the interest  
of it may, in part, defray the expense of instructors ; and  
 
Whereas this Institution is located in a part of Massachusetts where living is  
cheap where the climate is healthy where the surrounding country is delightful as  
well as fertile and where the good moral character of students is likely to be secure :  
 
Now, therefore, we, the undersigned, do hereby severally promise to pay to the  
said Trustees, or to any agent duly commissioned by them or to their order, the  
sum affixed to our respective names, annually for five years from the date, on de-  
mand, to be held or appropriated by the said Trustees for the use of said Collegiate  
Charity Institution.  
 
Provided, nevertheless, that no person shall be bound to pay any part of this sub-  
scription, unless the amount hereafter subscribed for the same purpose shall, within  
one year from the date, exceed thirty thousand dollars.  
 
Desirous of increasing the respectability and usefulness of an Institution which was  
founded in Charity and has been manifestly approved and blessed of heaven, and be-  
lieving it to be more blessed to give than to receive, and hoping hereby to advance  
the honor of our Redeemer and the best interests of man, we cheerfully subscribe.

The entire subscription is not copied in all these towns. But a fair specimen is  
given. In Sherburne, the subscribers seem to have paid in advance and discounted  
their own payments. Where the columns are left blank, payment was probably  
never made.

COPY OF THE OBLIGATION MENTIONED AND DESCRIBED ON PAGE 147.  
Whereas there are subscriptions to the thirty thousand dollar fund, so called, of  
the Amherst Collegiate Institution, some of which are made by females, and some  
by minors, as is supposed, we do hereby, for value received and for the better  
securing the payment of said part of said fund, guarantee to the Trustees of the  
Amherst Academy for the benefit of said Institution, the payment of all such sub-  
scriptions so made by females and minors, and all other subscriptions to said fund  
not exceeding one dollar a year.

SPECIMENS OF THE RIDICULE OF THIS SUBSCRIPTION BY THE ENEMIES OF  
THE COLLEGE. (SEE PAGE 541.)  
 
" On the [subscription] papers were found thirteen hundred and fifty-three sub-  
scribers, scattered over more than one hundred towns in Massachusetts, Connecticut  
and New York. Included in this number were two hundred and six females, mostly  
married women and infants ! There were many infants not females ; how many  
was not ascertained. There were five hundred and eighty-four subscriptions of one  
dollar each. There were two hundred and three of twenty-five cents each ; fifty-  
eight of fifty cents, many of twelve and a half cents, and some ten cents. One of two  
cents. All payable annually for five years. Small subscriptions from three female  
charitable societies. From two charity boxes. One female Mite Society. These  
would seem to be the last gleanings of charity." Extract from a statement of the affairs of  
the Amherst Institution on the th of October, 1824, compiled from evidence exhibited to the  
Committee of Examination, the pamphlet gotten up by the opposition and placed in  
the seats of the Representatives in the final debate on the charter. See pp. 148-9.  
 
When the College petitioned the Legislature for pecuniary aid in 1881, this sub  
scription again became a fruitful theme of ridicule and scorn. 1 subjoin a speci-  
men from the speech of Mr. Fuller of Boston, with the notes by which it was ac-  
companied in the Appeal by the Trustees to the public. See p. 182.  
 
" The thirty thousand dollar fund stood next in order of the Amherst Collegiate  
Institution. That fund was made up in part by a subscription of married women  
and minors, which was minus. One-half of it was utterly lost. The Committee  
could not find it. Certificates were indeed brought forward declaring that the fund  
was entire and clear. But when the Committee came to the investigation, it was  
thought best to patch up these subscriptions of women and minors, and a guaran-  
tee was made out that they should be paid. This was done while the Committee  
were holding their session in a room of the hotel in Worcester. 
["This, though a mistake of no importance in itself, may be taken as a specimen of Mr.  
Fuller's accuracy in the greatest charges which he so vehemently reiterates against the Col-  
lege. The Committee did not sit at Worcester but at Amherst."]
While the Com-  
mittee was sitting, some of the Trustees came out into the bar-room and got this  
bond of guarantee executed. It was signed by J. E. Minot 
["It is not known that any such man as J. E. Minot ever had anything to do with the In-  
stitution."]
and Nathan Smith.  
This Nathan Smith (though he [Mr. Fuller] did not know him and did not wish  
to) was found to be so infamous that the Legislature struck his name off from the  
list of Trustees.  
["'This Nathan Smith 'whom to have known would have been so contaminating to Mr.  
Fuller's moral purity is Nathaniel Smith, Esq., of Sunderland, who was for many years a  
member of the General Court; whose integrity, during a long life, will not suffer in compari-  
son with that of any other man in the community ; who has been the munificent patron not  
only of the College, but of nearly all the beneficent institutions of the day, and who regardless  
of privileged slander is passing the evening of life in the fruition of that benediction, 'It Is  
more blessed to give than to receive.' Mr. Fuller forgot to inform the House that this man  
who ' was found to be so infamous that the Legislature struck his name off from the list of  
Trustees', is now [1832] one of the five Trustees, appointed by joint ballot of the two Houses,  
to represent them in the Board and to assist in taking care of the College."]
 
"The whole subscription was basely got up. The whole of this fifty thousand  
dollars was subscribed for the purpose of removing Williams College to Amherst  
that was the pretence and the money was given with that design. After it is ob-  
tained for that purpose, what do these Trustees do? He would not say, they ex-  
actly put it in their own pockets but they had a kind of ambition they had rather  
be Presidents, Trustees and Professors than to have others imported perhaps they  
thought Williams College not hopefully pious enough, and so they made a College  
 
 
 
for themselves. As to the original begetting of the College, he would promise to  
 
say nothing about it such things were generally done in secret If you agree  
 
to give buildings, etc., to all who ask for them, there is scarcely a town in the Com-  
monwealth that would not want a College; for every town has some inhabitants as  
ambitious as the Reverend Heman Humphrey and his associates not that all such  
Colleges would be equal to Amherst, for it is said that heaven has protected them  
from all evil reports."

occasion may require, reasonable rules, orders and by-laws, not repugnant to the  
Constitution and laws of this Commonwealth, with reasonable penalties, for the  
good government of the said College, and for the regulation of their own body, and  
also to determine and regulate the course of instruction in said College, and to con-  
fer such Degrees as are usually conferred by Colleges in New England, [except  
medical degrees :] Provided, nevertheless, that no corporate business shall be transacted,

In Chapter X., pages 150 and 157, we have given some account of the influence  
exerted by the friends of Amherst College in changing the balance of political power  
in 1823, when it was wavering between the Federal and the Republican parties, and  
of the part which Rev. Austin Dickinson acted, in person and by his pen, in bring-  
ing about this change. We give below an article from his pen which was published  
in the National ^Egis at Worcester, April 2, 1823, and, in part at least, published  
also in other papers in Eastern Massachusetts and circulated as a handbill just be-  
fore the election. It was communicated to me by Rev. Oman Eastman and is at-  
tested by the Librarian of the Antiquarian Library at Worcester as a true copy  
from the National JEgis. It belongs to another age, not to say another world, from  
 
that in which we now live and move, and is perhaps more than a curiosity, it is  
perhaps due to history that it should be preserved as one among many illustrations  
of the times.  
 
FEDERAL REMONSTRANCE.  
 
3fr. Editor: We refuse to support Mr. Otis' nomination at the election, 1st, be-  
cause it cannot be said to be a nomination made by the Federal population of the  
State, but by the Boston and Cambridge junto. As an illustration of this fact let  
it only be remembered that in the convention that nominated Mr. Otis, if we are  
not mistaken, Boston had a greater representation than the four wealthy counties  
of Worcester, Franklin, Hampshire and Hayden, with a population about four  
times that of Boston.  
 
2d, We object to Mr. Otis, as Christian patriots, on account of his IMMORAL  
CHARACTER. We have too much regard for the honor of the Redeemer, and for  
the honor of Massachusetts to have it said to the world, that we have elected a man  
to rule over us, who in contempt of the laws of God and man, places himself on a  
level with the lowest by habitual profane swearing, and by the habitual violation of  
a command which we deem sacred, " Remember the Sabbath day to ketp it holy." We  
blush for the cause of Truth, when we notice what is said in some of the Boston  
papers, of pure moral character, and fear that the standard of morality which pre-  
vails among a certain class in that city, is not the standard of the Bible. We are  
not to be imposed upon by fair representations. Some of us have been in Boston  
and have seen and heard Mr. Otis, on the Sabbath as well as on other days.  
 
3d, We object to Mr. Otis because he is connected with a Boston and Harvard  
College aristocracy, who have for several years past manifested a disposition to  
have the disposal of all the important offices in the State; and because they are  
acquiring a religious, as well as political control, which we regard as dangerous to  
the civil and religious privileges of the great body of the Congregational, Baptist,  
Methodist, and Episcopalian friends of true religion in the State. We think that  
equal privileges should be extended to all denominations.  
 
We are disposed to support the Republican candidates for the present year be-  
cause we regard them as gentlemen of distinguished ability, integrity, patriotism,  
and truly liberal sentiments.  
 
Mr. Eustis, after being elected to Congress, by the united vote of the Federalists  
and Republicans of his district, has fulfilled the appointment to the entire satisfac-  
tion of all. Mr.. Lincoln fulfilled the arduous duties of Speaker of the House of  
Representatives, for the last year to the unanimous approbation of both parties, and  
so long as they continue to serve with ability, faithfulness and impartiality we are  
willing they should be our public servants. Our old partialities would indeed lead  
us to prefer persons of the Federal party who might be named ; but we are aware  
that setting up new candidates at the present time would prevent a choice being  
made by the people, and we dare not risk the consequences of having the election  
 
of Governor made by the Legislature.

NIMROUD SLABS AND THEIR TRANSLATION.  
 
One of the most curious and unique books it the Library of Amherst College  
bears the above title. It is mainly in manuscript. The remainder is made up of  
photographs. The title-page only is printed and reads as follows : " Photographs  
of the Inscriptions of the Mural Slabs now resting in the Dickinson Nineveh Gal-  
lery in Amherst College. Also the manuscript translation of the same, by Rev. W.  
H. Ward of the Class of 1856. The Slabs were procured by Rev. Henry Lobdell of  
the Class of 1849."  
 
Mr. Ward who has shed lustre on the College and the country by deciphering  
and translating these inscriptions, is now one of the editors of The Independent, and  
was offered the appointment of archaeologist in the exploring expedition just senfrout  
by the American Palestine Exploration Company to the country east of the Jordan.  
 
The first page of the manuscript bears the following separate title and introduc-  
tory note : " Translation of the Inscription repeated on the different Mural Slabs  
from the Palace of Assurnazirbal, King of Assyria, built in the City of Calah, the  
modern Nimroud. Assurnazirbal ascended the throne July 2, 930 years before  
Christ, (as deduced from a solar eclipse that occurred on that day and to which he  
often refers in his Annals as a favorable omen,) and reigned till 905 B. C. The  
lines in the Transliteration 
[Manuscript copy of the cuneiform characters, accompanied by interlinear translations.]
follow Slab No 3 in the Dickinson Nineveh Gallery,  
Amherst College. The same inscription is repeated on the Slabs from the same Pal-  
ace now in the Cabinets of Yale, Williams, and other Colleges."  
 
FREE TRANSLATION.  
 
This is the Palace of Assurnazirbal, servant of the supreme god, Assur, servant  
of the gods, Bel, the shining Ninib, Cannes and Dagon, servant of the great gods,  
great King, mighty King, King of Legions, King of Assyria, Son of Tiglath-Ni-  
nib, great King, mighty King, King of Legions, King of Assyria; Son of Bel-niza-  
ri, King of Legions, King of Assyria; strong Warrior who marched here and there  
in the service of Assur his lord ; who had no equal among the Princes of the four  
regions; brave Commander, fearing no opponents ; strong, unrivalled Leader, King  
bringing under subjection the rebels against him ; who governs many legions of  
men; mighty Champion trampling on the backs of his stout enemies, crushing all  
his foes, the masses of the rebels ; a King who marched here and there in the ser-  
vice of the great gods his lords, and whose hand subdued all the provinces, and  
who gained the mastery over all the forests, who subjected all their power, taking  
hostages, imposing laws over all those provinces.  
 
When the supreme god, Assur, speaking my name and enlarging my Royalty,  
gave his unstinted support to the service of my Royalty, I attacked the army of  
the land of Lulla, a land of extended waters. In the midst of battle I slew them  
with arrows to the delight ? of II, Ninib and Yav, gods whom I serve. The coun-  
tries of Nam, Gilhi, and Subarie I attacked and conquered.  
 
I am the King who reduced under his feet the territory from the ford of the  
Tigris unto Lebanon and the Mediterranean Sea, a land not previously acquired  
and also the land of Zuhi as far as the City of Kapigi; who annexed to his land the  
Territory from the source of the river Zubnat as far as Armenia, the neighborhood  
of Gilruri as far as Gozan, from the ford of the Lower Zab as far as the City Tel  
Bari which is beyond the province of the Zab, from the City Tel Abtani as far as  
the City Tel Zabtani, the cities of Hiritu and Harutu, a well watered ? country and  
also the land of Kardunias. Incorporated the inhabitants of the neighborhood of  
Bubite as far as Tarmar among the people, under my immediate sway. Over these  
territories I appointed my Lieutenants and imposed taxes.  
 
I am Assurnazirbal, humble servant of the great gods, generous stout soldier,  
capturing all the cities and open country, King of lords, devouring the rebellious,  
strengthening the peaceful, not fearing opponents, not sparing his foes, a King the  
glory of whose face has covered the lands and the seas which are reduced under  
his dominion, not fearing mighty kings and extending his power from the rising  
of the sun to its setting  
 
The early City of Calah which my predecessor, Shalmanezer, King of Assyria,  
had built, had fallen into decay. His city I rebuilt, captives which I had taken  
in the countries which I conquered, the land of Zuhi not previously conquered, the  
City of Lutga and the region of Euphrates, from all the land of Zamua, from the  
lands of Bitadini and Pate from Lubarna King of Patinai, I collected and trans-  
ported them to the City of Calah. I threw down the old mound and leveled it to  
the water. I laid in order one hundred and twenty courses on the bottom. I placed  
thereon a palace of cedar-wood, box-wood, cypress wood, arrow-wood, rukanni  
wood, butni wood and halpi wood, for the seat of my royalty, for the fullness of my  
princedom for all future time. I made in stone images of animals of the moun-  
tains and seas, and set them up in its gates and consecrated them. I roofed it with  
plates of copper. I hung in its gates folding doors of cedar-wood, box-wood, fir-wood  
and rukanni wood. I gathered in great quantities silver, gold, tin, copper, iron  
which I had captured in the countries which I conquered, and deposited them in  
the midst of the palace.  
 
WILLIAM HAYES WARD, '56.  
 
The above translation occupies four manuscript pages. Then follow nineteen  
pages of Transliteration and interlinear translation, (a page being devoted to each  
line of the inscription,) in which the inscription is first copied in cuneiform charac-  
ters, secondly reproduced word by word and letter by letter in the Roman alpha-  
bet, and thirdly translated literally, word for word, into English, thus exhibiting  
to the eye of the curious reader the structure and arrangement of the language and  
furnishing the philological student, so far forth, a chrestomathy for the study of its  
grammar and lexicography.  
 
The whole is dated "Independent Office, July 11, 1871," and inscribed, "A Jubilee Offering".

Pages 667-671 include the index and a statement: "On page 290, line 20, for Humphrey read Hitchcock".
