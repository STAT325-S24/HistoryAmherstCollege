    "text": "Text\nParagraph Number\nPage Number\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n1\n33\n\n\nAMHERST ACADEMY was the mother of Amherst College.\n1\n34\n\n\nThe Trustees of the Academy were also Trustees of the College,\n1\n34\n\n\nand the records of the Academy were the records of the\n1\n34\n\n\nCollege during the first four years of its existence. Some account\n1\n34\n\n\nof the Academy must, therefore, precede the history of\n1\n34\n\n\nthe College. The founding and erecting of Amherst Academy,\n1\n34\n\n\nkept pace with the origin and progress of the last war with\n1\n34\n\n\nGreat Britain. The subscription was started in 1812, when\n1\n34\n\n\nthat war was declared ; the Academy went into operation in\n1\n34\n\n\nDecember, 1814, the same year and the same month in which\n1\n34\n\n\nthe peace was signed ; and it was fully dedicated with illuminations\n1\n34\n\n\nand public rejoicings in 1815, when the return of peace\n1\n34\n\n\nwas known and hailed with joy in this country, especially in\n1\n34\n\n\nNew England. This synchronism is worthy of note, not as a\n1\n34\n\n\nmere accidental coincidence, but as illustrating the energy, resolution,\n1\n34\n\n\nand self-sacrificing spirit of the men who could raise\n1\n34\n\n\nsuch a sum of money and found such an Institution at the very\n1\n34\n\n\ntime when the industry and enterprise of New England were\n1\n34\n\n\noppressed as never before nor since, by a war which was peculiarly\n1\n34\n\n\nhostile to their industrial interests. The charter was not\n1\n34\n\n\nobtained, however, till 1816, having been delayed by opposition\n1\n34\n\n\nin Amherst, and in the neighboring towns, of the same kind\n1\n34\n\n\nand partly from the very same sources as that which the College\n1\n34\n\n\nencountered in later years.\n1\n34\n\n\n\n2\n34\n\n\nThe subscription was started by Samuel Fowler Dickinson,\n2\n34\n\n\nand Hezekiah Wright Strong, Esquires, the same men to whom,\n2\n34\n\n\nbeyond any other citizens of Amherst, the College afterwards\n2\n34\n\n\nowed its origin. Calvin Merrill of the village, and Justus Williams\n2\n34\n\n\nof South Amherst, were also quite active in raising funds\n2\n35\n\n\nand rearing the building. Dr. Parsons gave the land on which\n2\n35\n\n\nthe building was erected, lent all his influence to the raising of\n2\n35\n\n\nthe money, and was the first, and, until the establishment of the\n2\n35\n\n\nCollege, the only President of its Board of Trustees, and, to say\n2\n35\n\n\nthe least, one of its principal fathers and founders. The Trustees\n2\n35\n\n\nnamed in the act of incorporation were David Parsons, Nathan\n2\n35\n\n\nPerkins, Samuel F. Dickinson, Hezekiah W. Strong,\n2\n35\n\n\nNoah Webster, John Woodbridge, James Taylor, Nathaniel\n2\n35\n\n\nSmith, Josiah Dwight, Rufus Graves, Winthrop Bailey, Experience\n2\n35\n\n\nPorter, and Elijah Gridley. In common with other\n2\n35\n\n\nincorporated institutions of the kind, the Academy received\n2\n35\n\n\nfrom the Legislature of the State, the grant of half a township\n2\n35\n\n\nof land in the district of Maine, on condition that the inhabitants\n2\n35\n\n\nof the town should raise a sum of money which was\n2\n35\n\n\ndeemed its equivalent, viz : three thousand dollars.\n2\n35\n\n\n\n3\n35\n\n\nDuring the first ten or twelve years or more of its existence\n3\n35\n\n\nthe Academy was open to both sexes. The principal male\n3\n35\n\n\nteachers during this period, in their chronological order, were\n3\n35\n\n\nFrancis Bascom, Joseph Estabrook, John L. Parkhurst, Gerard\n3\n35\n\n\nHallock, Zenas Clapp, David Green, and Ebenezer S. Snell.\n3\n35\n\n\nThree of these were afterwards connected with the College as\n3\n35\n\n\ntutors or professors, one became the well-known editor and proprietor\n3\n35\n\n\nof The Journal of Commerce, and another an honored\n3\n35\n\n\nsecretary of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign\n3\n35\n\n\nMissions. The lady teachers were Lucy Douglas, afterwards\n3\n35\n\n\nMrs. James Fowler of Westfield, Orra White, afterwards Mrs.\n3\n35\n\n\nDr. Hitchcock, Mary Ann Field, afterwards Mrs. Henry Merrill,\n3\n35\n\n\nSarah S. Strong, [To this lady who became a teacher in the Academy at the age of sixteen, and a teacher of remarkable brilliancy, I am indebted for many facts in the early history\n3\n35\n\n\nof Amherst Academy, which but for her extraordinary memory must have\n3\n35\n\n\nperished with the fire that consumed the Records in 1838.] daughter of H. W. Strong, now Mrs.\n3\n35\n\n\nMcConihe of Troy, and Hannah Shepard, sister of Prof. Shepard,\n3\n35\n\n\nafterwards Mrs. Judge Terry of Hartford.\n3\n35\n\n\n\n4\n35\n\n\n” Under the government and instruction of such superior\n4\n35\n\n\nteachers,” I quote the language of a competent eye-witness,\n4\n35\n\n\n” the Academy obtained a reputation second to none in the\n4\n35\n\n\nState, and indeed the ladies’ department was in advance of the\n4\n36\n\n\nsame department in other institutions, as might be shown by a\n4\n36\n\n\nsimple comparison of the studies pursued and text-books in\n4\n36\n\n\nuse by the young ladies. Among these may be specified Chemistry,\n4\n36\n\n\nwhich was then just beginning to be studied in schools\n4\n36\n\n\noutside of Colleges, but was taught in Amherst Academy with\n4\n36\n\n\nlectures and experiments by Prof. Graves who had been lecturer\n4\n36\n\n\non Chemistry in Dartmouth College, Rhetoric, Logic,\n4\n36\n\n\nHistory, Paley’s Moral Philosophy, Play fair’s Euclid, Stewart’s\n4\n36\n\n\nPhilosophy, Enfield’s Natural Philosophy, Herschell’s Astronomy\n4\n36\n\n\nwith the calculation and projection of eclipses, Latin,\n4\n36\n\n\nFrench, etc. On Wednesday afternoons all the scholars were\n4\n36\n\n\nassembled in the upper hall for reviews, declamations, compositions\n4\n36\n\n\nand exercises in reading in which both gentlemen and\n4\n36\n\n\nladies participated. Spectators were admitted and were often\n4\n36\n\n\npresent in large numbers, among whom Dr. Parsons and Mr.\n4\n36\n\n\nWebster, President and Vice-President of the Board of Trustees,\n4\n36\n\n\nmight usually be seen, and often the lawyers, physicians,\n4\n36\n\n\nand other educated men of the place. Not unfrequently gentlemen\n4\n36\n\n\nfrom out of town were present, as for instance, Dr. Packard,\n4\n36\n\n\nwho early became a Trustee, and was much interested in\n4\n36\n\n\nthe prosperity of the Institution. Once a year, at the close of\n4\n36\n\n\nthe fall term in October, the old meeting-house was fitted up\n4\n36\n\n\nwith a stage and strange to tell in the staid town of Amherst\n4\n36\n\n\nwhere dancing was tabooed and cards never dared show themselves,\n4\n36\n\n\nreverend divines went with lawyers and doctors, and all\n4\n36\n\n\nclasses of their people to the house of God to witness a theatrical\n4\n36\n\n\nexhibition ! ”\n4\n36\n\n\n\n5\n36\n\n\nThe following sketch by one who was an Alumnus both of\n5\n36\n\n\nthe Academy and the College, (Rev. Nahum Gould of the Class\n5\n36\n\n\nof ’25) while affording a glimpse of the former, reveals one\n5\n36\n\n\nsecret, perhaps more than one, of the origin and prosperity of\n5\n36\n\n\nthe latter :\n5\n36\n\n\n\n6\n36\n\n\n” I came to Amherst in the spring of 1819 and studied in\n6\n36\n\n\npreparation for College under the direction of Joseph Estabrook\n6\n36\n\n\nand Gerard Hallock. The principal’s salary was $800\n6\n36\n\n\nper annum, and Miss Sarah Strong’s $20 a month. I found the\n6\n36\n\n\npiety of the students far in advance of my own. Perhaps\n6\n36\n\n\nthere never was a people that took such deep interest in the\n6\n37\n\n\nwelfare of students. None need leave on account of pecuniary\n6\n37\n\n\nembarrassments. Tuition was free to any pious student who\n6\n37\n\n\nwas preparing for the gospel ministry. Board was one dollar a\n6\n37\n\n\nweek, and if this could not be afforded, there were families\n6\n37\n\n\nready to take students for little services which they might render\n6\n37\n\n\nin their leisure hours. Their liberality was spoken of\n6\n37\n\n\nthrough the land, and it was an inducement to persons of limited\n6\n37\n\n\nmeans, preparing for the ministry, to come to Amherst.\n6\n37\n\n\nTo such the church prayer meeting in the village was a school\n6\n37\n\n\nas well as a place for devotion. Daniel A. Clark, the pastor,\n6\n37\n\n\nwas greatly beloved by the students. Noah Webster resided\n6\n37\n\n\nhere preparing his dictionary. He took an interest in the\n6\n37\n\n\nAcademy and opened his doors for an occasional reception,\n6\n37\n\n\nwhich we prized very highly. Col. Graves was a successful\n6\n37\n\n\nagent for the Academy and a help to the students. Mr. Estabrook\n6\n37\n\n\nwas well qualified for his station. Mr. Hallock was a\n6\n37\n\n\nscholar and a gentleman. It was a pleasant task to manage a\n6\n37\n\n\nschool where there were so many pious students seeking qualifications\n6\n37\n\n\nfor usefulness, who felt that they were in the right place\n6\n37\n\n\nand were establishing a Christian character of high standing.”\n6\n37\n\n\nIt is not surprising that such a school, under such auspices\n6\n37\n\n\nand influences, with such a standard of scholarship and Christian\n6\n37\n\n\nculture, flourished. It opened with more students than any\n6\n37\n\n\nother Academy in Western Massachusetts. It soon attracted\n6\n37\n\n\npupils from every part of New England. It had at one time\n6\n37\n\n\nninety pupils in the ladies’ department, and quite as many, usually\n6\n37\n\n\nmore, in the gentlemen’s. It was the Williston Seminary and\n6\n37\n\n\nthe Mount Holyoke of that day united. The founder of Mount\n6\n37\n\n\nHolyoke Seminary was a member of Amherst Academy in 1821.\n6\n37\n\n\nHer teacher, the lady principal, thus describes her : ” The\n6\n37\n\n\nnumber of young ladies that term was ninety-two. Some had\n6\n37\n\n\nbeen teachers. They were of all ages, from nine to thirty-two,\n6\n37\n\n\nand from all parts of Massachusetts and the adjoining States.\n6\n37\n\n\nAmong these pupils was one whose name is now famous in\n6\n37\n\n\nhistory. Then uncultivated in mind and manners, of large\n6\n37\n\n\nphysique, twenty-three or twenty-four years of age, and receiving\n6\n37\n\n\nher first impulse in education. She commenced with grammar\n6\n37\n\n\nand geography, and soon advanced to rhetoric and logic.\n6\n38\n\n\nHaving a comprehensive mind and being very assiduous in her\n6\n38\n\n\nstudies, she improved rapidly. Her name was Mary Lyon.”\n6\n38\n\n\n\n7\n38\n\n\nThe number of useful men whose names are ” written in\n7\n38\n\n\nheaven,” and not unknown on earth, who fitted for College and\n7\n38\n\n\nfor business during this period in the history of Amherst, was\n7\n38\n\n\nvery great. And the reputation and success of the classical\n7\n38\n\n\ndepartment became so remarkable, that partly to give fuller\n7\n38\n\n\nscope and perfection to this department, and partly to avoid\n7\n38\n\n\nsome difficulties and some scandals which at length arose from\n7\n38\n\n\neducating the two sexes together, the female department was\n7\n38\n\n\nabolished, and the Academy, thus entered on the second period,\n7\n38\n\n\nand in some respects a new one in its history, in which it was\n7\n38\n\n\nmainly distinguished as a school, preparatory for College.\n7\n38\n\n\n\n8\n38\n\n\nDuring this second period, Elijah Paine, Solomon Maxwell,\n8\n38\n\n\nStory Hebard, Robert E. Pattisou, William P. Paine, William\n8\n38\n\n\nThompson, Simeon Colton, William S. Tyler, Evangelinus Sophocles,\n8\n38\n\n\nEbenezer Burgess, George C. Partridge, Nahum Gale,\n8\n38\n\n\nand Lyman Coleman, were among the principal or assistant\n8\n38\n\n\nteachers. At this time, there were usually from seventy-five\n8\n38\n\n\nto one hundred students in the classical department, and in\n8\n38\n\n\nthe first year of Mr. Colton’s administration, the writer, who\n8\n38\n\n\nwas his assistant, well remembers that we sent about thirty to\n8\n38\n\n\nCollege, the larger part of whom entered at Amherst. Prior to\n8\n38\n\n\nthe existence of Williston Seminary, and during the depression\n8\n38\n\n\nof Phillips Academy at Andover, in the declining years of\n8\n38\n\n\nPrincipal Adams, if not still earlier, Amherst Academy, without\n8\n38\n\n\ndispute, held the first position among the Academies of Massachusetts.\n8\n38\n\n\n\n9\n38\n\n\n\n10\n38\n\n\nBut the subsequent prosperity of Phillips Academy, the establishment\n10\n38\n\n\nof Williston Seminary and the rise of Normal\n10\n38\n\n\nschools and High schools in all the large towns gradually drew\n10\n38\n\n\noff their students and thus their support from Amherst, and\n10\n38\n\n\nother comparatively unendowed Academies, till one after another\n10\n38\n\n\nof them became extinct. And although the Academy\n10\n38\n\n\nat Amherst sustained itself longer and better than many others,\n10\n38\n\n\nalthough it returned to the admission of both sexes in order to\n10\n38\n\n\nincrease the number of students, and although it was under the\n10\n38\n\n\ngovernment and instruction of some quite superior teachers who\n10\n39\n\n\nhave since become distinguished educators, yet it became more\n10\n39\n\n\nand more a merely local institution for the children of the town,\n10\n39\n\n\nand was at length superseded by our excellent High school. The\n10\n39\n\n\nbuilding which was a large three story edifice of brick occupying\n10\n39\n\n\none of the most beautiful sites in the centre of the village, and\n10\n39\n\n\nwhich was hallowed in the memory of so many hundreds and thousands,\n10\n39\n\n\nas not only the place where they received their education,\n10\n39\n\n\nbut also as the place where the first meetings for prayer and\n10\n39\n\n\nconference in the village, and all the social religious meetings of\n10\n39\n\n\nthe village church, were held for many years, this venerable\n10\n39\n\n\nand sacred edifice was taken down in the summer of 1868,\n10\n39\n\n\nto make way for the Grammar school, west of the hotel, which\n10\n39\n\n\nnow occupies the site. Amherst Academy did a great and\n10\n39\n\n\ngood work in and of itself for which many who were educated\n10\n39\n\n\nthere and not a few who were spiritually “born there,” will\n10\n39\n\n\nbless God forever. But the best work which it did and which,\n10\n39\n\n\nit is believed, will perpetuate its memory and its influence, was\n10\n39\n\n\nthe founding of Amherst College.\n10\n39\n\n\n\n11\n39"
